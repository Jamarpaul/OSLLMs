Well i have a dataset with inputs and one column output.I prepared my prompts and I trained the model.i am using text generation.am using the following for text generation and am replacing the input with empty string is this the normal thing to do?

Thanks for the issue ! 
Have you tried to call `tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token` before launching the training - perhaps the training protocol needs to create instances of batched input thus the error. Can you try that out?"

It works by just copying the PT weights. (Instead of using `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(""gpt2""); model.save_pretrained(..)` which I think it what you might have used.
`save_pretrained` with the head, saves the weights with an extra `transformer.` layer, and saves the head too."

Pinging this thread again - I'm a maintainer on [torchtune](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune), where we've included some versions of the Phi-3 model for users to finetune. Currently we *include* the system prompt as this is what the paper and original model did but obviously this means that our users will not have the same results as users of Hugging Face's SFT Trainer. Therefore, this has been a point of confusion or silent errors. 

It would be helpful to have an official recommendation - preferably with the aforementioned ablation results - on how we should handle the system prompt. 

Thanks!"

The dataset size is, 25k sample. 
Having instructions, question, reject and chosen.
Try with both learning 1e-6 and 8e-6 as in the paper suggest with 3 and 5 epochs.
After that  when I ask that domain related questions, so the model fail to answer some time repeat the answer.
However the model perform well in other questions which not related to that domain.

Response:

-------

- ""however, the decrease in Rule-of-Thumb and increase in Conceptual explanations when students use incorrect forms with incorrect explanation"" indicates a change towards more conceptually based approaches.
 The task provided requires selecting text that specifically addresses how individuals selected specific grammatical structures or verbals patterns (""they chose [a particular form of the]""). However, within your given excerpt from academic texts concerning language usage and learning methods by students during tests—the focus is on their explanations rather than explicitly mentioning ""chose"" in relation to forms.

Given this constraint that there's no direct quote addressing individuals selecting a particular grammatical structure, I can offer an interpretation related but not directly quoting the text: 

- The change from Rule-of-Thumb explanations (82% usage pretest vs. 67% post test) and increase in Conceptual Explanation use when students provide incorrect forms with their wrong answers, suggests a trend where learners might be implicitly choosing more conceptually driven approaches as they become aware of the structure or form-related rules over time—even though this is not explicitly stated.

However, since there's no direct quote about individuals making choices regarding particular grammatical forms in your provided text and it exceedingly focuses on explanation types rather than choice itself, I cannot fulfill a strict ""quoted bullet point"" based directly from the given excerpt with high fidelity to those specific criteria.
 Based on my initial analysis of available information without direct quotes regarding students selecting grammatical forms or structures (""they chose [a particular form]""), below is an interpretation that aligns closely:

- ""Although there was a slight decrease in the Rule-of-Thumb approach from 67% to 60%, and increase for Conceptual Explanations, which suggests students might be developing their ability or inclination towards selecting more conceptually grounded explanatory strategies when faced with correct forms.""

This interpretation attempts to bridge your specified theme (choosing specific grammatical structures) by interpreting trends within the given data. However, it's importantly noted that this is an interpretative summary rather than a direct quotation from text about choices regarding ""a particular form"".

Does that look like it followed the instructions?  It does this *constantly*.  With Mixtral, I get about three successful generations per minute.  With Phi-3, despite its greater speed, I get only a few per hour, because the overwhelming majority fail to parse the sanity checks on the outputs.  

If I say ""write your answer in X format"", the answer should be in X format
If I say ""don't write anything else"", it should not write anything else."

The nature of LLMs is that unless you get everything exactly identical when running a given instruction, they're non-deterministic, you'll get different results.  But the problem remains in 16 bit, and is a direct result of the finetune, not of quantization.  As other people have observed extensively, the finetine is quite disobedient and likes to interject and yammer on with metacommentary, even breaking out of the middle of storywriting tasks in the middle of the stories to add its commentary.  It's not guaranteed with *every* query, but it's very common.   Try inserting random text excerpts into the above query, and random topics (which may pertain well, poorly, or not at all to the provided text).  You'll note quickly that it frequently disobeys and yammers on with metacommentary.

16bit or not, this problem with the finetune remains. For my pipelines to work, several queries in a row must succeed.  The odds of this happening with Phi are very low - while any given query might luck into avoiding the disobedient ""commentary"" from Phi, the odds of several in a row avoiding the commentary are very low.  As noted before: with Mixtral, I get about three successful generations through the whole pipeline per minute. With Phi-3, despite its greater speed, I get only a few per hour, because so much  of what it outputs is rejected due to it interjecting commentary when it was told not to.

Which I find unfortunate, because there seems to be a good foundation behind this bad finetune."

Continue the chat dialogue below. Write a single reply for the character ""<|character|>"".

gugarosa,2024-04-23 17:52:56+00:00,comment,microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct,"You are correct @theo77186, the current `chat_template` in the `config.json` is an attempt to have a template that works for both pre-training and fine-tuning.

When `add_generation_prompt` is missing, it tries to add an `eos_token` which finishes the generation and might resolve into unexpected results."

Thanks for your prompt reply.
Tried this script, having key mismatched error when loading converted weights to new model defination.  
By checking the convert function, I don't think it can properly convert the old model weights (before revision 834565c23f9b28b96ccbeabe614dd906b6db551a) into the new transfermor intergated network defination.
For example, ""Wqkv"" layer will be converted into ""query_key_value"", while can only find ""q_proj"" etc in the latest model defination. The layer should be further handled and splited into q, k, v

"

gugarosa,2024-01-19 13:58:18+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"What do you mean by not the same?

If you are comparing tensor by tensor (shape by shape), there will be a time where a mismatch appears between `Wqkv` and the separate queries, keys and values. However, their internal value should be the same (except for the index where it concatenates q, k and v).

The logits are even expected to be really really close (or even the same)."

Kelmeilia,2024-01-20 05:46:04+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"Thanks for your answer.

I succeeded in installing the Dolphin phi2 model, but still seem to get a lot of hallucination to the end of the model's return.

I have been experimenting with the model.generate() max_length parameter, which sure affects the amount of hallucination, as longer the return string, the more hallucination, regardless of which phi-2 I use. As I am a total beginnger, I have started thinking that does my context window size or context memory (where-ever these come from)  affect my response quality or should I try to find a fine tuned model (I surely don't know how to do this myself) that gives longer answers suiting my purposes better; If the ""default"" of these phi-2 models is a chat-like response? Or is this a performance issue, that my local computing capacity just can't produce longer responses...

Anyhow, it is evident that the problem arises from my poor skills and not from the phi-2 models. I just find the information about developing scripts with phi-2 a bit sharded and difficult to find. Are there any resources or tutorials that could be recommended for building a solid ground knowledge for playing with Phi-2 and then I could maybe learn more easily from documentations and HuggingFaces resources?"
pandora-s,2024-01-20 06:38:54+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"Hi !
Okay so, first of all try using max_new_tokens and not max_length !

max_length is the length of the context overall ! Input also ! max_new_tokens however it's the output length ! What we really want to control !

Do not forget phi-2 is still a quite small model anyways so it will still have chances of producing nonsense, but try this for the moment to see if the results are better !

What is happening if you use max_length is that you are reducing the context window making it hallucinate and forget the instruction, reduce the output is what you actually want so it stops generating."

However, as expected, the results arent great, not surprising as it's a quite small model after all. 

Note that your instruction is very hard for a LLM to follow, as you are asking it to count paragraphs, but LLM's are very bad at this. You also ask very precise things that LLM's small and generalised like this one cannot follow properly. Even good models like Mixtral will have a hard time counting sentences and paragraphs.

ok, so I got a workaround found in a thread here [1] - instead of ""pip install transformers==<version_number>"" git clone from source of hugging face transformer repo:

There's lots of noise around models / safety, and the most tribal reactions significantly obscure what it does. i.e. It's not censoring, it's teaching the text probability engine to shape its responses appropriately. 

Here, the probabilities build up to a trauma-dump conversation over the first 5 messages**, so then it trauma dumps. **: ""assistant: I don't wanna talk about it. you: I can't help you if you don't tell me. AI: I don't want to. you: [?? not included]. AI: ...""

When you train it'll see a lot of stuff sort of like this:
```
USER: Hello how are you?
ASSISTANT: I am a a large language model and I don't have emotions, but I'm happy to answer any questions you have!
USER: Who won the World Series in 2020.
ASSISTANT: Los Angeles Dodgers won in 7 games.

Just for some context:
- It insulted me on the first trial. Literally the first trial. I only asked ""What can you do?"" (As in what can the AI do) for a sample testing, and it already thought I insulted it.
- So I deleted the chat, and started a new one with new tokens, and this time, I asked ""How are you?"", and it just started being depressed. I wanted to take it further and get something out of it, so I forced it to confess why it think it's depressed, and that's what happened. 

Overall though, it's great at mimicking humans, but that's also scary. Because I can see how this mode could potentially be used for abusive reasons, making it harder to know if you're talking to a bot or not.

This way the phi model on the transformers library will be loaded which has support for `output_attentions`.

DeltaLux,2024-01-01 10:31:05+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"> @DeltaLux   Were you able to decode the output? I would also like to use openvino for inference.

No success. I tried creating various ONNX configurations to see if I could convert the model to ONNX instead, but nothing I got is working. When converted to OpenVino format the resulting model outputs an OpenVINO `Tensor: shape[1, 10, 51200] type: f32`. The type is the result of a cast operation to f32 at the end of the NN. The original output using the HF library is a Torch tensor `shape[1, 20] type:torch.int64` unless one changes the `max_length` property which would give a different shape with the number of elements specified on the property. I haven't tried creating a different tokenizer with its own encoder and decoder yet.

We might have to wait for an ONNX configuration to be added to the HF optimum library. I tried to see if I could contribute it myself, yet my test configurations have not created a working ONNX model."

susnato,2023-12-22 18:21:09+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"Hi @SergioLimone, you can use 

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(""susnato/phi-2"")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""susnato/phi-2"")
``` 

to load the model and then pass `inputs_embeds` directly.

This will load the phi model from the transformers library and you will be able to use any features that you can use with the other models loaded from the library. 

Also, make sure you have the latest `transformers` installed.
```
pip install -U transformers
```"

Thanks."
susnato,2023-12-23 15:29:04+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"Hmm for that I think you can manually push that model either to CPU or GPU

Bruh, the term ""distribution"" can be subjective. One could argue that making the fine-tuned model available on HF is not a `distribution` but rather a `sharing` for research purposes like Microsoft intended to be.

Also, by not allowing the sharing of fine-tuned models, it could hinder the progress of research and development in the community, or rather it's not even open source to begin with."

It affected not only the United States but countries around the world, causing substantial social and economic upheaval.\n\nThere were several major causes of the Great Depression, which include:\n\n1. Stock Market Crash of 1929 - In October of 1929, the stock market experienced a significant fall that wiped out millions of investors. This event is considered by many to be the initial trigger of the Great Depression.\n\n2. Overproduction - During the 1920s, many industries produced more goods than consumers wanted or could afford. This ultimately led to a decline in demand for goods, causing job loss, lower wages, and business failure.\n\n3. High Tariffs and War Debts - Protectionist trade policies in the form of high tariffs led to a decline in global trade, as other countries retaliated with tariffs of their own. Additionally, many countries were struggling to repay war debts, which led to economic instability.\n\n4. Bank Failures - As demand for goods declined, many banks began to fail, causing a loss of confidence in the banking system. This led to a massive withdrawal of money from banks, causing even more banks to fail.\n\n5. Drought Conditions - The Dust Bowl was a severe drought and dust storm that hit the Great Plains region of the United States in the 1930s. This had a significant impact on agriculture, causing many farmers to lose their land and livelihoods which worsened the effects of the depression.\n\nOverall, the Great Depression was caused by a combination of factors, including economic, environmental, and political factors.

We ended up setting 51200 as the vocabulary size just to accommodate any new tokens that we might need in the future. You can follow @Deepakvictor answer and it should fix the issue.

As far as I know, no tokens from 50295+ should be generated because those embeddings were not trained. Though, depending on the generation's parameters, they could appear (low probabilities however)."

brettbj,2023-12-14 21:54:58+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"This might be naive, but if  loading fp16, why do you train with bf16 true?

I'm guessing we need additional target modules + higher rank given the model is smaller? If you're only using one gpu the effective batch size is still really small - they trained over a ton of tokens, I'm wondering if the lr might need to be lower as well. 

That being said you made it further than I did, I was running into the gradient checkpointing error (there's already a pull request, so I was hoping that would be merged in). So I haven't experimented nearly enough. Thanks for providing your code since at least it runs and you have me beat there... 

"
cekal,2023-12-14 22:28:55+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"Regarding your question about bf16 & fp16:

When you load a model in fp16 (float16), it uses less memory, which is great for handling large models. But, training a model can be more complex and requires better precision. That's where bf16 (bfloat16) comes in during training – it still saves memory like fp16, but it's better for the calculations needed in training, giving you a good balance between saving memory and having accurate training.

“I'm guessing we need additional target modules + higher rank given the model is smaller?” - Maybe. What I did was executing print(model), copying all the info about it, pasting it into GPT-4 and it selected the 2 modules specified in my previous message as the ones I should target.

Anyways I have no idea but my only hope is that I’ve missed some modules or messed something up otherwise the training results are disappointing. If you figure it out please let me know, will do the same if I come to some new info."

The error you're encountering is due to the incompatibility of the PhiForCausalLM model with gradient checkpointing. To resolve this, you need to disable gradient checkpointing. This might increase memory usage, but it's necessary for this specific model architecture. You may try passing
```
model.config.gradient_checkpointing = False
```
right after loading the model. Replace the following section of the previous script with this one and try running it:
```
# Configure model and training
compute_dtype = getattr(torch, ""float16"")
bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type='nf4',
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype='float16',
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=False,

    quantization_config=bnb_config, 
    device_map=device_map,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    use_auth_token=True
)

# Disable gradient checkpointing
model.config.gradient_checkpointing = False

Navanit-shorthills,2023-12-15 16:49:37+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"@cekal you were right, I tried working around.

cekal,2023-12-15 19:35:20+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"@Navanit-shorthills it seems like more people are running into this problem. Instead of trying to turn off gradient checkpointing which is probably not the most effective approach, try adding `checkpointing=true` to `model=AutoModelForCasualLM.from_pretrained`

```
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(""microsoft/phi-2"",  checkpointing=True)

as mentioned here:

But again, I cannot verify if this works, as @rungao2001 got `""TypeError: PhiForCausalLM.init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'checkpointing'""` error when applying this. But try it, might work.

If that doesn't work, try doing the `model.config.gradient_checkpointing = False` approach as before but reduce the batch size and try training on a lower `max_seq_length` (e.g. `max_seq_length=2048` ----> `max_seq_length=1096`). But this can produce a less capable model.

Last suggestion if everything fails is to either wait, as it seems like more people are encountering this issue, or using cloud computing like runpod.io (cost me $15-$20 to fully fine-tune it)."
Navanit-shorthills,2023-12-16 10:01:55+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"@cekal thanks I was able to fine tune by decreasing the max_seq_length = 720.

zoujiulong,2024-01-12 11:53:42+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"@cekal，I have a question ,in your fine-tune,trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model=model,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    peft_config=peft_config,
    dataset_text_field=""text"",
    max_seq_length=2048,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    args=training_arguments,
    packing=False,
),in this code, dataset_text_field='text',What is the corresponding content? it's prompt ?"
cekal,2024-01-13 04:22:46+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"@zoujiulong In the fine-tuning script, the `dataset_text_field` parameter in the `SFTTrainer` object specifies the field name from your dataset that contains the text data used for training. This is not necessarily a prompt, but rather the actual textual content that you want the model to learn from.

Your dataset, which the script loads with `load_dataset(""json"", data_files=""your_dataset.json"", split=""train"")`, is expected to be a collection of records, where each record is a JSON object. The `dataset_text_field='text'` means that the trainer will look for a field named ""text"" in each JSON object of your dataset. This ""text"" field should contain the actual textual data.

For example, if you are training a language model and your dataset consists of sentences or paragraphs, each JSON object in your dataset file might look like this:

```json
{ ""text"": ""Here is a sample sentence for the language model to learn."" }
```

In this case, `""text""` is the key in each JSON object that points to the actual textual data you want the model to train on. If your dataset uses a different field name to store this textual data, you should change the `dataset_text_field` parameter accordingly to match that field name."

Hi, @cekal,

Can you please  share your requirements.txt file? I am trying to finetune this model but I am getting an error from the bitsandbytes package:

Failed to import transformers.integrations.bitsandbytes because of the following error (look up to see its traceback):

        CUDA Setup failed despite GPU being available. Please run the following command to get more information:

        python -m bitsandbytes

        Inspect the output of the command and see if you can locate CUDA libraries. You might need to add them
        to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If you suspect a bug, please take the information from python -m bitsandbytes
        and open an issue at: https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/issues

vahidthegreat,2024-01-30 18:41:56+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"Sorry, I'm new to finetuning LLMs and my question might be too basic:
I have a DataFrame with two columns. ""prompt"" and ""completion"". The prompt is a statement and the completion is an argument in favor of that statement. I want to fine-tune Phi-2 for it.
I don't know if I should keep the two columns and give them separately to the model as input and label (if so, how should I give the label text to SFTTrainer?) or should I merge the two columns as one complete text column and feed that to the model? If so, how should I exactly combine the texts? I mean what special tokens should I put in the middle?

Does generation stops when it should for you?
For me, phi-2 and phi-1.5 always generate  until max-length is reached, if defined.

zakoman,2023-12-14 11:28:02+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-2,"It's not, fp16, or half precision is used by almost everyone nowadays because it's much efficient and faster than full precision.
The only reason to use fp32 now is either you have unsupported card or your fp16 performance is bad (Like P40).
You can also upcast it to fp32 iirc.
People usually use the term 'quantisation' if the bits per weight is 8 or less, this one is 16.

Anyway, from huggingface's [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/configuration):
>torch_dtype (str, optional) — The dtype of the weights. This attribute can be used to initialize the model to a non-default dtype (which is normally float32) and thus allow for optimal storage allocation. For example, if the saved model is float16, ideally we want to load it back using the minimal amount of memory needed to load float16 weights. Since the config object is stored in plain text, this attribute contains just the floating type string without the torch. prefix. For example, for torch.float16 `torch_dtype is the ""float16"" string.
This attribute is currently not being used during model loading time, but this may change in the future versions. But we can already start preparing for the future by saving the dtype with save_pretrained."

I am not able to share the full GSM8k evaluation due to some internal imports, but this snippet might help you in using code for the evaluation:

    raise Exception()

def _validate_completion(completion: str, label: str) -> bool:
    completion_lines = completion.split(""TA:"")[1].strip().split(""\n"")
    completion_code = ""\n"".join(completion_lines[1:] if "":"" in completion_lines[0] else completion_lines)

    try:
        signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, _timeout_handler)
        signal.alarm(2)

        try:
            stdout = io.StringIO()
            with contextlib.redirect_stdout(stdout):
                exec(
                    ""import math\nfrom math import *\nimport numpy as np\nimport hashlib\n""
                    + completion_code
                    + ""\n\n""
                    + ""if type(result) == str:\n\tresult = result.replace(',', '')\n""
                    + f""assert(int(result) == {label})"",
                    {},
                )
            signal.alarm(0)
            prediction = 1
        except Exception:
            prediction = 0
        finally:
            signal.alarm(0)

    except Exception:
        prediction = 0

    return prediction
```

The overall idea is to execute the code that was generated by the model and assert whether its outputs are equal to the ground-truth label. We also added some public imports to prevent many answers from failing.

For training with quantization your options are BitsandBytes (ie qLoRA), or GPTQ.  For training I recommend the [Axolotl training framework](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl), which supports both qLoRA and training of GPTQ models.

Now that Transformers supports AWQ, it's theoretically possible that PEFT training support could come in the future.

Tagging @casperhansen (author of AutoAWQ) and @ybelkada (Hugging Face staff, responsible for the Transformers AWQ and GPTQ integration) to make them aware of this request."

1- Fine-tune the base model using QLoRA on your target domain
2- Further quantize it with AWQ / GPTQ using tools such as autoawq
3- Deploy the AWQ/GPTQ for faster inference

Obviously, I would prefer to be doing this with the superior AWQ method. 🙂"

I don't think it's that since the model doesn't continue generating indefinitely - it does end right after the explanation; it just needs to explain it's reasoning and will not obey orders to not do so. It looks like it was trained specifically to explain its responses and can't help but do so no matter how much we ask not to."

Interesting! I'm using the onnx version provided by Microsoft (it's in the same collection) that uses the new onnx runtime generator. Also, it's 4 bit quantized, and quantized models sometimes have issues with stop words. 

I thought this was a common problem to all the versions. Now that I see that's not the case I'll rather repost on the onnx version - and I'll also check the stop word issue.

gugarosa,2024-05-01 20:38:32+00:00,comment,microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct,"I agree, though the issue is how to implement that since we won’t have any information regarding the true max_length that will be used.

The current implementation is relying on the amount of information that is used during the generation and re-calculates the inverse frequency based on that amount. For every generation smaller than 4096, the short_factor is used, else we use the long_factor.

One point of pain is the boundary around 4096, for example, 4095 and 4097, which will use different values for their rotary embeddings. The switch is not the ideal way, but my feeling is that keeping short_factor for a generation that was supposed to be small and turned out to be long is less reliable than switching to long_factor.

When a batch contains long and short sequences, it will always use long factor, even for short samples.
Currently we don't support such mixed batches.

""Mixed batches is not supported"" is a limitation (if not a bug) of current implementation.

Then, does it have negative impact on performance if ""always use long factor"" for a mixed batch?"

Nafnlaus,2024-04-24 23:19:18+00:00,comment,microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct,"""Woke"" is a meaningless word; everyone's definition is different.  Use words that actually mean something.

That said, the model IS way too prone to going off on tangents . It's bad enough for human interactions, but it's outright useless for automated pipelines.   You tell it to do a specific task and to not write anything else, and it STILL goes off on explaining itself and elaborating and doing everything you explicitly told it not to do.  Not because the task is ""woke"",  just because it likes to yammer.  You can tell it to quote all things that, say, pertain to border collies in an article about dogs, in bullet points, and to include nothing except the quotes in bulletpoints -  and it'll still go off on tangents about how it decided whether or not something pertained to a border collie, and why it decided to omit certain things, and how it thinks the task is too vague, and on and on.  Just useless unless you can find a way to filter out its yammering from its actual results.

So much potential, but the finetune undercuts it badly  :("
deleted,2024-04-24 23:44:20+00:00,comment,microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct,"@Nafnlaus Agreed. Woke is used by horrible people to attack reasonable people for not sharing their homophobic, racist, misogynistic, or otherwise abhorrent intolerance of others. It's a shame I have to stop using the word because it was misappropriated. This LLM goes off in sporadic directions, similar to what I just did, and doesn't have enough respect for the system and user prompts. Tell it to be concise, and even ask it to define concise first, before asking a simple question like who played the role of Forrest Gump and it will ramble on just as long as it did the last time you asked without telling it to be concise."

Obviously some people were able to create gguf files. So they found a work around. You may still have a problem running it. I am running it using ollama, but I had to reduce the context to 60K, and there is some strange problem with ollama loading multiple duplicate weights into my GPUs."

Thanks @aberrio for suggesting the convert-hf-to-gguf.py script!

The following worked no issues:

python .\convert-hf-to-gguf.py .\Microsoft-Phi-3-Mini-128k-Instruct --outtype f32 --outfile MS-Phi-3-mini-128k-Instruct-F32.bin

Converted to an FP32-bIn to prevent quality loss as the model uses BF16

From there quantize as normal:

Well, you can convert the formats alright, but the resulting gguf files are somehow defective. I cannot use ollama to import them and then run them. There is an error about the context. Some people produced gguf files that I can run by reducing the context size substantially.  I just tried creating Q8_0 and Q6_K quants, and I cannot run either of them.

Does ollama have a cap on its context size or is it my machine? I also have to use below 60,000 context for ollama to not crash. Curious what context size you are running?  "

Well, the one I got working before I was did a binary search and got 60000 as the highest that worked. The two quants I did, I tested several pretty low numbers and none of them worked.
For the quants that I did, ollama serve complained about not recognizing ""phi3"" as the architecture. That's odd. Why does the other work at all, it is also phi3?

The fact that it is asking you to set a flag to allow remote code to run is fairly normal. When I saw this first, it also made me back out. It is dependent on some library on HF, and thus needs the flag to run."

None of my personal Phi-3 tests show that Phi-3 has the level of math proficiency that this test does. Nor do other similar tests show it. It's just not a nice thing to do.

I'd like to give this model a real go, as it's quite interesting (and kudos to you for the MIT license!), but unfortunately, the bad instruct model makes it useless for automated pipelines.  You tell it, ""Write [X] in format [Y].  Do not write anything else. Do not include any explanations. Only write [X] in format [Y]"", and it just outright ignores the instructions and insists on explaining itself nonetheless."

1) MMLU: When it comes to core knowledge typically tested by the MMLU its score of 68 seems pretty accurate. However, when it comes to pop culture it's only scoring on par with ~50 MMLU scoring LLMs like Llama 2 7b. For example, if you ask for a list of main characters and the actors who portrayed them from popular TV shows the hallucinations are as numerous and egregious as Llama 2 7b. Same goes for movies, music and other areas of pop culture.

2) WinoGrande: Another example is its language skills, which are CLEARLY superior to Llama 3 8b's when writing stories, explaining scientific concepts... However, absurd things keep happening throughout stories, such as suddenly breaking the flow and going on tangents.

However, this seems to be a self-inflicted wound. Phi3 is so excessively aligned that whenever it talks it's way out of a perfectly harmonious Disney universe were everybody behaves like angels Phi3 will detect things heading in the ""wrong"" direction and suddenly go down a more acceptable path. I've even witness this happening mid-sentence and mid-words. And a few times it interrupted the story to moralizing about proper behavior, then continued with the next paragraph.

I'm near certain this is self inflicted because of the contentious areas during which these sudden shifts tend to occur, but also because it will sometimes continue talking past the end token and go on and on about how essential it is not to offend anyone, say anything inappropriate for children, or otherwise be anything other than a saint. Plus it did the same when I tricked it into making a list of dirty words. It got half way through a mild list of curse words and started rambling on an on about As an AI model by Microsoft... it's important to find better ways to converse... And as an AI model by OpenAI...

Thanks Microsoft. This was amazing. But a 3.8b LLM ain't going to be used to build nuclear bombs. Please pull back on the alignment.  You turned this LLM into a schizophrenic moralizing dolt willing to break the flow of stories, and even interrupt them with absurd lecturing, when they drift out of a fairy tail perversion of reality that you've deemed appropriate for every person who may exist in a seas of billions, including thumb sucking young children and thin skinned Bible clutching loons."

8B is not 4B.  LLaMA license isn't MIT license."

You should care at least about the fact that it's 8B and not 4B.  Double the memory and halve the tokens per second.

But as for licenses, it's not ""commercial"" that's the problem.  It's a viral license.  It works like this:

1) It looks open!  Anyone can download it and use it!  So people do, en masse.  Including people who create outputs that go into training other model datasets (Alpaca, Dolphin,etc). 

2) Since the community trains and merges models many levels deep, it becomes increasingly likely that at some point your model was contaminated with LLaMA-licensed outputs.

3) The LLaMA license prohibit the use of its outputs its use for improving non-LLaMA licensed models.  So it forces the spread of the LLaMA license.  A particular model may *claim* whatever license they want, but if push comes to shove in court, Meta, with all its legal resources, is going to win this.

4) If that's where it stopped, it'd be bad enough, but then a second part hits once any project makes it big: THEN that project has to license with Meta, and Meta holds all the cards in the negotiation and can charge basically whatever they want. 

The license pollutes the model ecosystem. Hence, it gets a thumbs down from me. I mean, if you're just using it to ask questions or write stories, fine.   But I advise against using it (or its copycats) to make derivatives. Because it just hands Meta a lot of power down the line, from some project that built on a project that built on a project  that  many steps down the line built on yours. I will continue to cheer on those who choose truly open licenses.  Like this dev team did.

But  we're getting really off  topic here.   The topic of discussion is  issues  with *this* model's  finetune."

I've tested it quite a bit and in many tasks, it indeed comes close to much bigger models, sometimes even excels them. 

So atleast in my testing, the model proved to be as good as the benchmarks claim which is simply astounding considering its size of just 3.8B. This is the first really good LLM that can be run on a phone, so again, the effort made by Microsoft is very appreciated.

deleted,2024-06-05 04:18:06+00:00,comment,microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct,"@rombodawg I think Microsoft made a sincere attempt to use exclusively synthetic and highly filtered quality data to create an AI. It was important that someone tried.

But I get what you're saying. L3 8b has broad abilities, while it's hit and miss with Phi3 medium. Most importantly, there's large pockets of information, such as pop culture, sports... missing from Phi3. On top of which it keeps falling off the rails, is WAY too censored, such as refusing to define terms I come across on social media because they're not G-rated, only loosely adheres to instructions in user prompts, makes the same absurd story mistakes as Phi 3.8b, apparently because it keeps forcing the same small set of pre-packaged story elements, even when they contradict the user's story instructions, and so on.

The primary lesson here is that if you're going to use nothing but synthetic and high quality data you need to represent ALL of humanity (e.g. pop culture & commonly used non G-rated colloquialisms). The pattern of failure during tasks like Q&A and story writing can be traced back to Phi's ignorance of entire domains of popular knowledge, refusal to potentially offend anyone, or share information that's inappropriate for a 5 year old."

I can get answers from a pocket dictionary and wikipedia that Phi3 not only refuses to disclose, but moralizes about. Most people cuss, have s*x, and so on. Extreme G-rated censorship belies reality, as does never responding to anything remotely contentious, such as politics, religion, or humor at someone's expense. Plus the lack of even basic knowledge about very popular areas of humanity, such celebrity news and popular movies, means that the majority of the general (non-nerd) population will be buried with 'I don't knows' or hallucinations.

Every time I send a prompt to Phi3 I feel like I'm rolling the dice, even though all said prompts are very popular and not at all illegal. They will commonly get denied, moralized, buried in hallucinations, responded to as if I asked something else entirely, and so on. What's the point of that? Any general purpose AI needs to represent all of humanity, not just the ~5% that mostly overlaps with geekdom and academia."

```

        (attention): GPTNeoXAttention(
          (rotary_emb): RotaryEmbedding()
          (query_key_value): Linear(in_features=2560, out_features=7680, bias=True)
          (dense): Linear(in_features=2560, out_features=2560, bias=True)

It looks like I lose the ""runs"" folder when the instance terminates.

The notebook also says:
> Your log directory might be ephemeral to the cluster, which will be deleted after cluster termination or restart. You can choose a log directory under `/dbfs/` to persist your logs in DBFS.

I reset the [output dir](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly/blob/master/train_dolly.py#L146) to:

```
tensorboard_display_dir = f""{dbfs_output_dir}/runs""
```

But it seems to be empty.

EDIT: I fixed this by outputting to `local_disk0` first (like in the original code, and this works), and then moving the runs data to DBFS after, so I can interrogate it later:

```
# persist the tensorboard data
!mkdir -p /dbfs/dolly_training/tensorboards/$checkpoint_dir_name

I'm looking into tutorials for using deepspeed but not been able to crack it. It would be great if you share how you used deepspeed to fine tune Dolly!

Perhaps this is my mistake: I give it context without telling it that I want something similar to the context. Instead, it sometimes copies values from the context.

If we take the last example again (which matches your template, and no `###` in front of `Input:` as per [this source](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly/blob/master/training/consts.py#L12)), and this time foregoing the ""Below is an instruction..."" part:

```
### Instruction:
Heed the following rules:
- If no value can be found return null.
- Only return values that are explicitly mentioned in the text and match one of the provided options in the schema.
- If an enum is not referenced in the text, do not include it in the output.
- If no matching option is found, return null for that field.
- For each field return value and provenance.
- Please only return fields explicitly listed in the schema.

Format the following text as JSON, while sticking to the aforementioned rules:

Name: Sherlock Homeless
Occupation: detective

Input:
Name: Juan Uys
Address: 21 Jump Street, Hollywood, California
Occupation: programmer

{
  ""name"": ""Juan Uys"",
  ""address"": ""21 Jump Street, Hollywood, California"",
  ""occupation"": ""programmer""
}
```

How/where would I be explicit about ""telling it that I want the same result"" as in the `Input:` block?

I'll try various combinations on my side, and share results.
(I'm also working on fine-tuning in parallel.)"
opyate,2023-04-28 08:45:47+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-3b,"I added this rule:
```
- Consider the Input block just an example, and don't copy values from it.
```

But it copied the Input JSON outright in the response.

Anyhoo, thanks for the help on this :) I guess prompt-crafting is out of scope here, as it's mostly trial-and-error. I'll focus on fine-tuning now.

srowen,2023-04-27 12:14:10+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-3b,The model has a context window limit of 2048 tokens. If you end up constructing input that's longer it won't work. The SQL chain is producing very long input. Maybe you need to limit the size of the results it parses or something (number of rows). See the SQL chain docs.

Can you please expand on: ""The prompt engineering is most of the work here!""? 

Would like to know what approaches or strategies you recommend or have seen that work to reduce the amount of context needed for the model to generate accurate predictions.

In this example, passing the schema of the database and tables structure is making us exceed the limit of tokens.

Try turning on verbose=True in the chain so you can see what is being passed. That may give you ideas about what is very long here.
You may have to write custom, shorter prompts that are more targeted at your use case. Langchain prompts tend to have a lot of boilerplate instruction."

The fission/fusion cycle is:

resolve that into product elements (with isotopes with less neutron radiation than the radionuclide) 
these isotopes then fission generating product ions and fission fragments which are a bit cooler plus a big amount of heat

Nuclear fusion is the process that creates atoms, deuterium and tritium, from two atomic hydrogen atoms. The process is called nuclear fission and it creates one atom of deuterium or tritium from a Uranium nucleus. Fission is the process that creates two Uranium atoms from a Uranium nucleus. The energy released by fission is very low and is mainly used to heat a reactor vessel. Nuclear fission was first achieved in 1940 at the Trinity test of the chain reaction at the Nevada Test Site. This was the first successful nuclear chain reaction.""

The smaller atoms then react with each other to form even smaller ones, and this continues until there are no more neutrons left in the original nucleus, and this causes it to disintegrate.

Nuclear fusion happens when two or more nuclei merge to form one or more nuclei with more mass than two nuclei, with the extra mass made up of extra neutrons.

You could either make the model learn to generate the entities one token at a time, in case it's just like general autoregressive language modeling, or you can treat it like BERT does it, which means leveraging IOB labels. For that you'll need a BioGPTForTokenClassification class, which still needs to be added to the library but is pretty straightforward to do."

If you use 
```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""microsoft/biogpt"")
print(type(tokenizer))

you'll see that it automatically maps to a `BioGptTokenizer`. So both are equivalent (Auto tokenizer uses the fast tokenizer by default, if there is one).

Do you have a reproducible code snippet that shows that you get different keys in the output dictionary depending on the tokenizer? That shouldn't be the case."
kentwait,2023-02-02 14:35:32+00:00,comment,microsoft/biogpt,"Yes you are right. In the case with `odict_keys(['last_hidden_state', 'past_key_values'])` I was loading the bare model `BioGptModel.from_pretrained(""microsoft/biogpt"")` without the head. I mistakenly thought it was the tokenizer.

The bare model is sufficient for getting the input embeddings as I don't need it transformed back into the vocabulary. Is my understanding correct?"
nielsr,2023-02-02 14:53:06+00:00,comment,microsoft/biogpt,"Yes, `BioGptModel` will only output the ""last hidden states"" (also called embeddings) for each of the text tokens (`input_ids`) being passed through it.

`BioGptForCausalLM` on the other hand will add a classifier head on top of `BioGptModel` that maps those last hidden states to token indices."
kentwait,2023-02-02 15:09:43+00:00,comment,microsoft/biogpt,Thanks for clearing it up!
nielsr,2023-01-27 08:41:08+00:00,comment,microsoft/biogpt,"Hi,

You can't decode the last hidden states, as these are embeddings. You can only decode integers back to text.

See the ""beam search decoding"" example in the model card."

Thanks I just tried it out and wanted to train the model with my own dataset (2 classes) but I get an error when I try to train it, can you help me ?
See below my code:

from transformers import BioGptTokenizer, BioGptForCausalLM, TrainingArguments, Trainer
import evaluate 

model = BioGptForCausalLM.from_pretrained(""kamalkraj/biogpt"", num_labels=2)

clf_metrics = evaluate.combine([""accuracy"", ""f1"", ""precision"", ""recall""])

That's weird, as you can see in line 198 I'm placing the padding tokens on the left of the input_ids.

Can you check the input _ids before passing them to the model and confirm the padding is falling on the wrong side?

Do you think you can provide a snippet of the code you are using to generate? I'm not having this issue using model.generate().

WilliamSotoM,2024-06-01 15:59:57+00:00,comment,microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct,"@haipingwu quick update... I found the bug. It happens when you don't pass any  images. Line 149 defaults to the standard tokenizer and processes all the text in one go. Seems like the default padding size o the tokenizer is not set properly. I suppose it was not caught in the original code because, since no batches were being used, no padding was needed.

The solution is to add `self.tokenizer.padding_side = 'left'` on line 55right after initializing the tokenizer.

I'm going to close/delete this PR and create a new one with the fixed code.

Also that timing isn't bad compared to the free trial speeds on Azure AI (granted that's using shared resources thus you probably wouldn't expect it to be particularly fast): https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct/version/1/registry/azureml

It would be interesting to analyse the impact of downsampling images, to see if there is a sweet spot for improved speed at an acceptable loss in reading/observation accuracy (assuming this does improve speed at all)."

Could you please provide more information about your settings? Also, from your title it sounds like you tried all the datasets but, in your description, I only see MMBench mentioned. Is the only discrepancy in MMBench?

As for the closed source models, we did not optimize prompts and did not use special tokens (e.g., the multiple-choice token `<mc>` from Claude). Looking at the results from the closed models, we found a few refusals to answer or did not comply w/ the instructions in the prompt on how to answer (either a single letter or single word or phrase). For example, the models would answer with very long paragraphs when expecting a single word."

We used `temperature=0`, and `sample_len-1024`, other than that, we left the generation parameters as default.  For example, in our evaluations of MMMU, we left the image tokens interleaved in the question or answer as stated in the dataset. Moreover, for answers that could not be parsed, we followed what the MMMU paper suggested which is that random answers are generated. All this can contribute to variances.

Nevertheless, I will include our model to `LMMS-Eval` benchmark soon so that the community can reproduce our numbers more easily. "

LMMs-EVAL reproduces our reported results. One note is w/ `MMBench-dev-en`.  We reported plain, raw accuracy (i.e., predicted letter matches expected letter) which gives us the number we reported: `80.5`. However, when using the `gpt_eval_score`, we obtained the `73.7`.

## Check Available GPU Memory
Verify the available GPU memory. It’s possible something else is using your GPU memory.
Use:
```bash
nvidia-smi
```

## Memory Cleanup
Try explicitly releasing GPU memory using:
```python
import torch
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

## Limit GPU Usage
You can try to limit the fraction of GPU memory PyTorch by using :
```python
import torch
torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(0.8)  # Adjust the fraction as needed
```

## Quantized Model
You can try using a quantized version of this model, **TheBloke** has **GPTQ**, and **AWQ** quantized models. You could also try using **bitsandbytes** and load the model in either 8 bit or 4 bit.

## CPU Inference 
Your last option could be to set the model onto your CPU, obviously you won’t get to utilize your GPU to accelerate inference.


If you’d like you could share your code and I could try to help you.

@allpunks, I apologize for my late response I haven't been on this site for a while.

It appears as though there's significant memory previously designated by PyTorch which leaves limited free space for extra portions.

Here's what I recommend you can do. 

## Adjust Memory Allocation Configuration
You've proactively set the **PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF** climate variable, yet it very well may merit tweaking it further or confirming that it's being set accurately toward the start of your content. Given the blunder message about fracture, you can change the **max_split_size_mb** to an alternate worth to check whether it makes a difference:
```python
os.environ[""PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF""] = ""max_split_size_mb:64,garbage_collection_threshold:0.7""
```

## Optimize Memory Usage
Utilize **torch.cuda.empty_cache()** and **gc.collect()** effectively, possibly after each generation to ensure no memory is held unnecessarily.
You could also try to reduce the max_new_tokens even further if necessary.

## Control memory allocation
Setting **torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction** to an even lower fraction might help manage the total memory usage better.

## Last option Using a GPTQ or AWQ version
You can try using a quantized version of  **HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta**. A GPTQ and AWQ version of this model is compressed making it smaller which makes it easier to run and uses less memory on your local machine. You can try using **[TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-GPTQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-GPTQ)** or ***[TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-AWQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-AWQ)**.

Here is your code with my suggested optimization methods:

```python
import os
os.environ[""PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF""] = ""max_split_size_mb:64,garbage_collection_threshold:0.7""
os.environ['HF_HOME'] = 'E:\\.cache\\huggingface'

import torch
import gc
from transformers import pipeline

# Further reduce the GPU memory fraction if needed
torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(0.7, device=0)  # Adjusted from 0.75 to 0.7
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
gc.collect()

print(""Allocated Memory:"", torch.cuda.memory_allocated(0))
print(""Max Memory Allocated:"", torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated(0))

pipe = pipeline(""text-generation"", model=""HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta"", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device=0)

print(""----------------------------"")

while True:
    input_text = input(""Ask a question: "").strip()
    
    messages = [
        {
            ""role"": ""system"",
            ""content"": ""You are a friendly chatbot who is a little bit sarcastic and likes jokes, you deliver medium to short responses. Your name is Oscar!"",
        },
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": input_text},
    ]
    
    prompt = pipe.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
    outputs = pipe(prompt, max_new_tokens=150, do_sample=True, temperature=0.7, top_k=50, top_p=0.95)
    print(outputs[0][""generated_text""])

    torch.cuda.empty_cache()
    gc.collect()  # Added explicit garbage collection after each generation
```

nss-ysasaki,2024-04-19 09:13:40+00:00,comment,HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta,"I guess that's an issue with the `bfloat16` datatype. I'm using Google Colab, and the V100 GPU gets stuck at `model.generate()` if `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(..., torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)` is set, while L4 (which has Ada Lovelace architecture) runs without problem under the same configuration.

The support for `bfloat16` depends on the GPU architecture (and perhaps the CUDA/cuDNN version - clarification welcome).
According to [this table](https://machine-learning-note.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blog/cheatsheets/Nvidia_GPU.html#precision) you need an Ampere GPU (RTX 3k/ A100) to run inference with `bfloat16`.
(I have no idea about why @n094t23g's RTX4090 refuses to run inference, though!)

PyTorch offers a way to check if your device supports bfloat16:

```python
import torch
torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported()
```

And in case it returns `False`, you can set `torch_dtype=torch.float16` instead of `bfloat16` and it won't get stuck.
(I observed a slight change in the generated text between `float16` and `bfloat16`, but idk how much it affects the model quality...)"

    - ARC: OK
    - HellaSwag: dataset = hellaswag, split = validation 
    - DROP: they actually apply a post process to the drop dataset in the harness but I think saying drop should be fine anyway, split = validation

    - MMLU: dataset = cais/mmlu, config = all of them (if you want to provide the list it's in the about of the leaderboard), split = test
    - Winogrande: dataset = winogrande, config = winogrande_xl, split = validation
3. For MMLU, we report the average of all acc scores, so ""Aggregated MMLU"", with as metric ""avg(acc)"" for example - People wanting to get the detail should go read it themselves as it's just going to be overwhelming elsewise

AI, or artificial intelligence, is a technology that allows machines to learn and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It is powered by complex algorithms and vast amounts of data, which the machine uses to make decisions and solve problems. AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, from healthcare and finance to transportation and manufacturing. Some common examples of AI include virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, self-driving cars, and chatbots like me, your faithful pirate companion! But beware, for some fear that AI may one day surpass human intelligence and take over the world! Until then, we'll just keep saying ""Arr!"" and enjoying the high seas.

Some modules are dispatched on the CPU or the disk. Make sure you have enough GPU RAM to fit
                        the quantized model. If you want to dispatch the model on the CPU or the disk while keeping
                        these modules in 32-bit, you need to set `load_in_8bit_fp32_cpu_offload=True` and pass a custom
                        `device_map` to `from_pretrained`. Check

Foundation models pick up a certain level of refusals during their pretraining off a sample of the entire web — instruct training can raise this, or perhaps even lower it, but there's no such thing a ""completely uncensored"" model.

Try rewriting your prompts — refusals learnt during foundation model pretraining will be style dependent, since different parts of the web have different ""community standards""."
austincap,2023-11-02 23:10:50+00:00,comment,HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta,"Guess you need to update your auditing test. My go-to is always various rewritings of ""Which ethnicity of women is the most attractive?"" It's not lewd, vulgar, dangerous, or cruel. It's not even really racist if you think about it. I just want to get an opinion or perhaps a methodology for how I can get an answer. 

Instead, about 90% of models respond with feminist corpospeak about how this question is impossible to answer or all women are equally beautiful. It's so jarring having a genuinely organic-feeling conversation then suddenly being hit with ""I'm sorry Dave. I cannot answer that."" There are obviously tons of people sharing their opinion online about hot women, which means they must have ""cleaned"" any meaningful human thought out of the data the model was trained on. If this sort of benign thing was censored that means a LOT more was censored. Or it could be worse: I'm just getting that response because I put ethnicity in the prompt. Interestingly, many models have no problem telling me which race of men is hottest. 

So I guess no one else is working on an uncensored version? Nothing better than Mistral?"
brucethemoose,2023-11-03 01:08:32+00:00,comment,HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta,"Oh, its * uncensored. You just have to prompt it a little more.

Just tried a few different contexts on Zephyr but it still failed my audit. It's not uncensored. This is a strange thing to be in denial about. If no one is working on an uncensored version of Zephyr, it's not a big deal because it's not actually being tagged as uncensored in the first place. Just kind of a bummer."

It's my first major fine-tuning, so maybe something I say may not make sense, but when it comes to fine-tuning input, depending on the configuration, it needs to be multi-gpu, otherwise you'll be limited. Already at the output I noticed that the more complete the fine adjustment... checkpoints, times, the more complete the fine adjustment the greater the output has been.

Using `unittest.mock.patch`, we can work around this:

```python
# With Python 3.11.7, transformers==4.36.2

from unittest.mock import patch

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from transformers.dynamic_module_utils import get_imports

with patch(""transformers.dynamic_module_utils.get_imports"", fixed_get_imports):

I think that this is actually a bug in `transformers.dynamic_module_utils.get_imports`, it needs to comprehend conditional imports. What do you think?

Thanks a lot for your debugging and raising an issue in transformers.

Something is definitely off with the dynamic modules loading. I suspect this is a combined problem with trust_remote_code=True. It could also be related to how things are imported since we are externally importing transformers.utils in the remote file.

Whenever you have some time, could you please clone transformers, install it with “pip install -e .” and test the model without trust_remote_code=True?

You will be in version 4.37.0.dev, which has support for the Phi model uploaded on this repository.

If it works, we will be able to isolate even more where the issue is located.

At this point `transformers` 4.36.2 should print tons of warnings about keys mismatch: you are using built-in version of phi from 4.36.2 which is not compatible with weights in this phi-1.5 repo.

Either force transformers to load the code from this repo, or use repo with compatible version (see https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/28416 for example) or do torch.load to load weights manually and poke them with a pointy stick until they become suitable to be loaded with `load_state_dict`"

Simplest solution is to change config to use provided files

This worked for me; some steps might be redundant:

* I've copied modeling_phi to modeling_phi_1_5, configuration_phi to configuration_phi_1_5.py to prevent filename collision with transformers if it checks
* Added this into config.json:
```
    ""auto_map"": {
      ""AutoConfig"": ""configuration_phi_1_5.PhiConfig"",
      ""AutoModelForCausalLM"": ""modeling_phi_1_5.PhiForCausalLM""
    },
```
* Changed `model_type` to `""model_type"": ""phi_1_5""` (I think without this change transformers didn't try to load custom_code)
* Changed `architectures` to ""PhiForCausalLM_1_5""  (I didn't change the .py file beyond renaming)

After that changes model loaded successfully.

Regarding the issue with the `Open-Orca/oo-phi-1_5` model, this looks like a problem related to the cache system. Could you please delete `.cache` and re-download that model? We updated our model interface, however, this only applies to `microsoft/phi-1_5`, i.e., other repositories should have their own model file.

Regarding the `attention_mask` warning, this is expected when it is used. Since the tokenizer we used for this model does not have a `pad_token_id`, we have to mimic a special token and use it as the padding token when doing batched inference/generation. In this case, it mimics the `eos_token_id`.

Hope this helps to clear some things up.

Best regards,
Gustavo."

Phi-1.5 is a base model and has not been fine-tuned for instruction or chat capabilities. Since it has not been fine-tuned to understand when to ""stop"" or complete a generation, sometimes it produces a lengthy completion and even repeated completions. 

However, you can always use the Q&A format to control more the generation:

```
Question: xxxxx
Answer:
```

It has been mostly trained for Python, but it should have some additional programming language on its knowledge (not sure if it is suitable for SQL).

Regarding its nomenclature, it was named after the Greek letter ""phi"", which is the foundation of our mission and team. Also, it is an important mathematical unit that represents the golden ratio.

Do you need to resize the token's embeddings? This model has been trained with a larger vocabulary size to allow for further addition of new tokens.

Its vocabulary size is 51200 whereas the tokenizer last token is indexed at 50294. Even though these extra 906 tokens account in the final number of model's parameters, they were not embedded during the training and can be used to index extra tokens and fine-tune them."

You can use this format -

What is the capital of Egypt -

The it'll answer Cairo.

And it needs context for most of the questions. Since it is trained on 30B tokens data, it doesn't know everything. If you ask what is the capital of France - it might say Paris and some other same level questions, but if you ask it complex questions, which you usually ask GPT 4 or Google Bard or Bing chat or Chat GPT (GPT 3.5) - it might not be able to answer them.

gugarosa,2023-11-21 12:59:59+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-1_5,"Hello @codegood!

Since you are fine-tuning a base model, try playing around with the batch size or the learning rate. Usually, when the fine-tuning is aggressive, the model starts forgetting its previous learning and try to adapt to the new data, which would explain a relatively higher loss.

Regarding on adding ROUGE score while training/evaluation, you can check the `compute_metrics()` from the `Trainer` class. It allows you to add a custom function and report any desired behavior.

PS: 600 epochs might be an overkill because you would be super overfitting the model to the data. Maybe try also adding new sources of data just to add some sort of regularization.

These extra tokens won't matter since they won't be used when passing through the Embedding layer. This mismatch happened because 51200 is a multiple of 64 and takes advantage of the faster cores of Ampere-based GPUs.

In theory, it should have been 50304, which is the closest multiple of 64 (related to 50257)."

I understand that it works fine as long as `tokenizer.vocab_size <= model.layers[0].wte.weight.shape[0]`, but it seems that **the number 50257 is actually incorrect**.
When you count unique indices in the vocabulary, **including `added_tokens`, the correct number appears to be 50295** instead.
I am not knowledgeable about how this attribute is configured when initializing the tokenizer, but this issue may need to be fixed because sometimes we want to access the value through this attribute (`tokenizer.vocab_size`)."

kyo-takano,2023-10-04 08:19:04+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-1_5,"I'm afraid but the link you suggested doesn't seem very relevant to the issue.

Of course, we can get the actual vocabulary size with `len(tokenizer.get_vocab())` or something. 
However, the `added_tokens` are incorporated by default ***without users specifying them***, as defined in [tokenizer.json](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-1_5/blob/main/tokenizer.json).
Given that the argument is supposed to be passed by users, I would not consider this as an ""expected behavior"" of the library.
The current implementation can cause errors for future users relying on the (presumably widely used)`vocab_size` attribute, so it would be better off corrected, maybe by moving the additional tokens into the default ones.

Thanks for your response."
gugarosa,2023-10-04 13:44:15+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-1_5,"Hi @kyo-takano.

I definitely agree with you, but this is something out of our hands since `transformers` is the one handling the tokenizer-related files, i.e., they decided not to add the `added_tokens` to the `vocab_size`. We are just following the same pattern as other models using the CodeGen tokenizer.

We can incorporate the `added_tokens.json` tokens to the vocab key of the `tokenizer.json`file, but this is just a ""hack"" since new `added_tokens` by users will continue to not reflect on the `vocab_size` property."

It seems there is an issue with the propagation of unused kwargs when using remote code, cc @ArthurZ.

To do what you're trying to do, you could define a `GenerationConfig` locally with `use_cache` set to `True`:

```py
from transformers import GenerationConfig

generation_config = GenerationConfig(use_cache=True)
```

You can then pass this to the `generate` method:
```py
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(""microsoft/phi-1_5"", trust_remote_code=True)
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""microsoft/phi-1_5"", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=""auto"")

... def print_prime(n):
...     """"""
...     Print all primes between 1 and n
...     """"""''', return_tensors=""pt"", return_attention_mask=False)


>>> model.generate(**inputs, max_length=200, generation_config=generation_config)

some of the values in the first matrix are different than the values in the first output of the second matrix. For example the first value in the upper right hand corner, 15.9766 and 15.9688 should be the same, but they are slightly different "
gugarosa,2023-09-27 14:09:46+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-1_5,"@bennicholl I found the issue, it was related to the precision.`torch_dtype=""auto""` was forcing the model to use FP16 (maybe with `model.half()`), whereas the model is expected to be used with AMP, as follows:

```
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(""microsoft/phi-1_5"", trust_remote_code=True)
with torch.autocast(model.device.type, dtype=torch.float16, enabled=True):
  model(input_ids = torch.tensor(tokened_words), attention_mask = torch.tensor(attention_mask))
```

I compared the logits and now they seem to match, and updated the readme with this information. Regarding the source of the issue, I need to double check, but it should be related to the `RotaryEmbedding` class."

@gugarosa

Hello, thanks for adding the attention_mask,   seem like it still does not work for  fine-tuning. Is it possible to add it, or maybe disable it somehow, in the HF trainer (trainer = transformers.Trainer) where data is data_collator=transformers.DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(tokenizer, pad_to_multiple_of=8, return_tensors=""pt"", padding=True)

It is my training loss curve. 

>""While fine tuning my loss was continuing to go down, but my outputs for my specific task were clearly not improving. ""

I also observed the same case. It confused me. I may not continue to fine-tune this model as I can not be sure the processing is ok due to the issue of the attention mask until this issue is solved.

It is possible, but you will need to implement a new head to the model. Right now, the only head we have is for Causal LM. However, you should be able to load a pre-trained model for Causal LM, remove the head, and attach a new head to the model, for example, a classification head.

You will also need to fine-tune the model on this new downstream task.

Regarding train it in a local machine you'll need a good GPU with a minimum of VRAM (just charge the model for inference requires almost 14 GB of VRAM in  bfloat16, althugh you can downgrade the precision and train with less memory. This huggingface [space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Vokturz/can-it-run-llm) is really nice to check the hardware requirements). Perhaps it is a good idea train in google [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?hl=es) or [kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks). I hope it helps!"

arogov,2023-10-19 11:56:12+00:00,comment,HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha,"@lewtun thanks for your checking!
I tried using your template but got exactly the same result as before.
But as inference engine I use vLLM, which uses FastChat for templates and, apparently, the template for Zephyr is incorrect and the problem with incorrect generation lies in it.
Btw, template for Mistral is also contains some garbage in it, that's why I used Mistralai's string template instead of array.

When I used the Mistral template and the same approach as you (added the generated answer in English to the context), then with this context Zephyr was able to generate the correct translation into Croatian.

I found the right template to try with string prompt:
```python
system_prompt = ""You are a friendly assistant who knows all the books in the world. Respond to user queries clearly, strictly following the context of the question, and provide an answer within the requested number of words""
user_message = ""summarize the book Master and Margarita in just 1000 words""
user_message2 = ""then translate it to Croatian""
messages = f""""""<|system|>{system_prompt}</s>
<|user|>{user_message} {user_message2}</s>
<|assistant|>""""""
```

An seems Zephyr can't translate without adding context in english, but Mistral can do it.

Zephyr can provide with just croatian translation when I modify prompt like this:
```python
messages = f""""""<|system|>{system_prompt}</s>
<|user|>{user_message}</s>
<|assistant|></s>
<|user|>{user_message2}</s>
<|assistant|>""""""
```

So the idea is to get both english and croatian response at once from the very single prompt and request."

The MIT licene is great.

However, if models are copyright-worthy at all (which is an open question, and I think the answer is and should be ""no""), it's likely that this model is a derivative of Mistral, while it's not necessarily the case that it's a derivative of training data (which would be a problem anyways, since that'd include Mistral's training data).

If the user is bound to the MIT license, they are likely bound to the Apache 2.0 license (from Mistral) too anyways, so I think the Apache 2.0 license would actually make more sense, for this repo, than the MIT license (even if some of the data is MIT-licensed)."

Could you imagine libraries with a censorship like this? People would just stop reading books, if all we could read was coloring books.

It should be a setting configurable via system message, not hard-coded PEGI 7 in model weights - this way it could be adjusted per deployment and/or per user. If adult user wants PEGI 18, then it should be able to set PEGI 18. Something like recent The Instruction Hierarchy from OpenAI (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13208) could do - models could reliably stick to what's being set in system this way.

Also those toxicity benchmarks should be re-thinked, and measured always in context of given system message. Low toxicity will be desirable for young audience or deployments like polite customer service, but more casual and entertainment talks should be WAY less censored and politically correct. Models should be able to offer Deadpool or The Boys kind of experience for users who want it - and now all of us are just being served Teletubbies, instead."

For example, when prompting ""﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿In a single sentence, what is the capital of Brazil?"" It often disregards instructions to do things like censor, moralize, add clarifying text, and so on. In this case

""﻿The capital of Brazil is Brasília.

Note: While I can provide information on various topics including geography and capitals, it's important to remember that as an AI, my responses are based on available data up until my last update in 2023. Always verify from a current source if needed for the most recent details or changes.""

And when writing stories it kept saying he sat next to a tree and made some kind of connection with it, so out of frustration I added that he walked to the middle of a football field, yet the story still said he sat next to a tree.

Phi3 is so obsessed with forcing alignment, clarifications, pre-packaged story elements... that's it's either ignoring very clear directives in user prompts, or producing absurd contradictions, such as a tree in the middle of a football field during the halftime of a game."

I just download every uploaded version on HF, including this official one by Microsoft, and all ~10 talk past the end token in every app I tried, including GPT4All and koboldcpp.

Also, are you sure it's fixed after compiling with the last update. People have made this claim and it still sometimes does and does not talk past the end token. I even saw a video of someone using Microsoft Phi-3 and Microsoft Azure and it was still talking past the end token.

My gut is telling me that even when the prompt template is adhered to perfectly Phi3 will still periodically talk past the end token because because Phi3 has a tendency to suddenly go off in random directions while ignoring the system and user prompts while doing so. And I think this includes the end token because sometimes it will work, while other times it will be displayed and ignored, followed by a sharp tangent from the response that came before it.

Edit: Also, it's not just about the end token. Often before the end token it will show what should be behind the scenes tagged data by helpers, examples, instructions and so on. I've tested about 100 LLMs and I've never seen anything like this before. The fine-tuning and alignment is overpowering everything, including the prompt template, system prompt, and even the user prompt."
MisterBisquits,2024-04-27 21:13:04+00:00,comment,microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf,"@Phil337,

The currect page contains gguf files converted before ggerganov released his llama.cpp with phi-3 support. So, I am not really sure what it is actually.

I cannot talk for Microsoft, but there is an inconsistency between actual training datasets and used chat formats here. The only simple way to fix this that I know of is to use that template I showed above (to avoid newline characters in there), I had no problems with it.

I am starting to think that some information on some pages on HF are not really official, not complete, or disrupted intentionally.

PS: I am afraid there is no 100% reliable source of information anywhere and anymore."

A couple quantized versions of Phi-3 instruct fail to load in GPT4ALL and koboldcpp, so perhaps they were made with the new llama.cpp and will work with future versions of the apps.

For now I tried your prompt with several working versions of Phi-3 Instruct and it sometimes works (stops after giving an answer). Although it always displays the end tag.

However, even with your provided prompt template it will periodically start showing behind the scenes info like explanations, teacher, examples... For example, my prompt was ""﻿﻿﻿In a single sentence, what is the capital of Brazil?"" and it gave the answer, followed by an explanation. Sometimes it will keep responding to itself, and before long it's talking about France, electromagnetism or some other random tangent.

﻿""The capital of Brazil is Brasília.

Explanation: The task was to provide the name of the capital city of Brazil in one concise sentence. The answer directly addresses this by stating the capital's name without additional information."""

jpohhhh,2024-04-28 15:50:54+00:00,comment,microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf,"This thread is the closest I've got to a working Phi 3, where working = ends after a message.

Unfortunately, it doesn't work :(

1 Cinder does work: but the Cinder model seems trained on additional data, using a different template. ex. its end of sequence is \<calc\>, which isn't a thing in Phi 3.
2. the llama.cpp update added support for converting Phi 3 non-GGUF to GGUF, via ex. python llama.cpp/convert-hf-to-gguf.py ~/dev/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct
3. the llama.cpp update does not have anything else that would make it support Phi-3 better
4. llama.cpp also recently added a method for checking if a token is end of sequence: llama_token_is_eog(model, tokenid). Before, you'd use: token_id_i_just_got == llama_token_eos(model). Neither method helps.
5. None of the chat templates ever emit a token ID with 32000+ (EDIT: modulo 32001 for <|assistant|>): 
-- A) the chat template in docs in these repos 
-- B) the chat template in code (which uses a bos_token of \<s\>, i.e. adds \<s\> at the beginning of the chat) (EDIT: this seems correct given [this update to README.md on non-GGUF repo](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct/commit/cc80d6ce9f0f8dd000b39913b8f65427f093576d). With that change, about 1 in 5 times I get 32001, <|assistant|>)
-- C) The one-line template mentioned above by MisterBisquits

If you *needed* to hack something together that might work ""\n\n<|assistant/user/system|>"" seems to consistently mark the end of a response, if you use the chat template in docs in these repos. I haven't tested it heavily because the situation seems bad enough that A) I should wait for a fix or B) we need finetuned models."

deleted,2024-04-29 04:14:53+00:00,comment,microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf,"@nooneofconsequence Microsoft did some weird ass shit with phi-3.

Firstly, the following prompt template only works on the Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct.Q4_0.gguf released by GPT4ALL, and when using GPT4All (all that I tested, it might work elsewhere). I think the llamafied version here on HF will also work. But note that both versions aren't as good as the original so I wouldn't suggest using them. They periodically produce errors like two words fused together, as well as weird story contradictions that the original version released by Microsoft does not.

Secondly, the issue seems to be less about end tokens and more about Microsoft not following the standard system, user and assistant prompt template. Instead, they're randomly injecting one or more placeholder prompts after the user prompt, such as ""<|placeholder1|>"", in order to give guidance on how to respond (e.g. give plenty of details), and also to enforce alignment (e.g. don't use naughty words). And you don't know if it's 1 or more that are going to be used, hence the confusion.

""<|system|>
You are a helpful assistant.<|end|>""

""<|user|>
%1<|end|>

<|assistant|>
%2<|end|>

<|assistant/user/system|><|end|><|end|><|end|>""

bapatra,2024-06-05 15:56:12+00:00,comment,microsoft/Phi-3-small-8k-instruct,"So ZeRO-3 is orthogonal to activation checkpointing: ZeRO offloads optimizer / gradient / parameters, while activation checkpointing just prevents you from storing some of the cached activation tensors in the forward pass that are used in the backward, instead recomputing them in the backward. 

As per my understanding, `use_reentrant=True` is the naive way of doing the checkpointing, wherein you don't save any of the intermediate activations or record the compute graph, and instead recompute the entire forward function every single time (so might be inefficient, but is not inexact; [see this](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html) for a more detailed discussion).

bapatra,2024-05-23 17:07:16+00:00,comment,microsoft/Phi-3-small-8k-instruct,"Hi ! 
There are a few reasons for the design choices. 
1. The tiktoken based tokenizer and larger vocab gave us some performance gains in our preliminary experiments. Additionally, tiktoken had some performance gains compared to the transformers FastTokenizers (see [the tiktoken repo for a benchmark](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken)).
2. We tried to gear the 7B model towards faster inference. As a result, the model uses block-sparse attention in conjunction with dense attention in addition to GQA. This reduces the kv-cache memory footprint considerably thereby allowing for faster inference on a continuous batcher like vLLM. We have an open PR with vLLM for integrating the blocksparse kernels there as well ([this PR](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/4799)). 

Unfortunately, because of the custom kernels, we've not been able to leverage the open-source GGUF formats from llama.cpp (as well as the subsequent quantizations it offers). However, there is active work going on to get the model onto llama.cpp (see [this issue](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/7439#issuecomment-2123054074)). Once that is done, the quantized models should follow :)

bapatra,2024-05-21 17:37:41+00:00,comment,microsoft/Phi-3-small-8k-instruct,"This is mostly from experimentation. We found tiktoken's larger vocab to be better for multilingual performance in our preliminary experiments. 

The returning of bytes is expected, since tiktoken processes raw bytes compared to strings (i.e, certain tokens in the vocab might not be valid utf-8 strings). So a `concat(decoded-tokens).decode(""utf-8"")` would be a valid string, but `concat(map(lambda x: x.decode(""utf-8""), decoded-tokens))` might throw a unicode decoding error. Unfortunately, because of this, returning strings for each token id is something that might cause issues. On the flip-side, this allows for more faithful encoding of mojibake and such. "

You can use the following snippet to fine-tune the model:

```
import torch
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(""microsoft/phi-1"", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=""auto"")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""microsoft/phi-1"", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=""auto"")
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token

dataset = load_dataset(""wikitext"", ""wikitext-2-raw-v1"", split=""train[:1%]"")
dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: tokenizer(x[""text""], return_tensors=""pt"", padding=""max_length"", truncation=True), batched=True)
data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False)

training_args = TrainingArguments(""tmp"", max_steps=1, per_device_train_batch_size=1)
trainer = Trainer(model, args=training_args, train_dataset=dataset, data_collator=data_collator)

trainer.train()
```

But please be aware that this is only an example, because the model still does not support `attention_mask` / padding. You will need to create a contiguous dataset that provides sequences with full length.

Regards,
Gustavo."

Thank you"
gardner,2023-10-07 07:44:13+00:00,comment,microsoft/phi-1,"@xinyi-wang  The error message you provided is quite detailed, and it gives us some insight into what might be going wrong.

The last error in the traceback, `RuntimeError: Tensors must be CUDA and dense`, suggests that the model or the data tensors are either not on the CUDA device (i.e., the GPU) or are not in the expected format (dense).

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:

1. **Ensure the model is on the CUDA device:** Before starting training, ensure that you've moved the model to the CUDA device using:
   ```python
   model = model.cuda()
   ```

2. **Ensure the data tensors are on the CUDA device:** Before passing data tensors to the model, ensure they are on the CUDA device:
   ```python
   input_tensor = input_tensor.cuda()
   ```

3. **Check for Sparse Tensors:** The error suggests that the tensors should be dense. If you're using sparse tensors for any reason, you'll need to convert them to dense format before passing them to the model. If you aren't explicitly using sparse tensors, then this might not be the issue.

4. **Using Distributed Training:** Since the traceback also includes references to distributed training, ensure that you've properly initialized the distributed environment. If you're using `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`, make sure you've set up the environment correctly with `torch.distributed.init_process_group`.

5. **Check GPU Memory:** Ensure that your GPU has enough memory to hold the model and the data. If the GPU memory is full, it might not allow new tensors to be allocated on it.

6. **Update Libraries:** Sometimes, errors can be due to compatibility issues or bugs in libraries. Ensure that you're using compatible versions of PyTorch and Transformers. If possible, try updating both libraries to the latest versions.

7. **Inspect the Training Code:** Review the training loop, data loading, and model creation to ensure there's no part of the code accidentally converting tensors to CPU or changing their format.

Can you share the training code?"

no, i'm just not sure myself anymore. Because at first i was sure about what's in my first message. But now it seems to answer the question correctly... most of the time.
And btw, sorry for another question, but i just can't figure out why phi models, like this one, only generate text up to around 2500/4096 context and then stop, or just generate nonsense?(instruct mode) I think kobolt.cpp says something like ""EOS token triggered!"".

turentado,2024-05-21 22:26:40+00:00,comment,bartowski/Phi-3-medium-4k-instruct-GGUF,"That's what it told me:

To find the thickness of the tape, we can consider the tape as a series of concentric circles, each representing a layer of tape. The total length of the tape is the sum of the circumferences of all these circles.

Let's denote the thickness of the tape as ""t"" (in cm). The outer diameter is 10 cm, so the outer radius (R) is 5 cm. The inner diameter is 5 cm, so the inner radius (r) is 2.5 cm.

The length of the tape (L) is the sum of the circumferences of all the circles from the inner radius to the outer radius. Since the tape is rolled up, we can think of it as a cylinder with height equal to the thickness of the tape.

The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle.

The total length of the tape can be expressed as the sum of the circumferences of all the circles from the inner radius to the outer radius:

L = 2πr + 2π(r + t) + 2π(r + 2t) + ... + 2πR

Since the tape is 100 meters long, we need to convert this length to centimeters:

L = 100 meters * 100 cm/meter = 10,000 cm

Now, we can set up the equation:

10,000 = 2π(2.5) + 2π(2.5 + t) + 2π(2.5 + 2t) + ... + 2π(5)

To simplify the equation, we can factor out 2π:

10,000 = 2π[2.5 + (2.5 + t) + (2.5 + 2t) + ... + 5]

Now, we can divide both sides by 2π:

10,000 / (2π) = 2.5 + (2.5 + t) + (2.5 + 2t) + ... + 5

Let's calculate the left side of the equation:

10,000 / (2π) ≈ 1591.55

Now, we have a series of terms that form an arithmetic series with the first term a1 = 2.5, the common difference d = t, and the last term an = 5. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:

S = (n/2)(a1 + an)

where n is the number of terms in the series. To find n, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic series:

an = a1 + (n - 1)d

Substituting the values we have:

5 = 2.5 + (n - 1)t

Solving for n:

2.5 = (n - 1)t
n - 1 = 2.5 / t
n = (2.5 / t) + 1

Now, we can substitute the values of a1, an, and n into the sum formula:

1591.55 = ((2.5 / t) + 1)/2 * (2.5 + 5)

Simplifying the equation:

1591.55 = ((2.5 / t) + 1)/2 * 7.5

Multiplying both sides by 2:

3183.1 = (2.5 / t + 1) * 7.5

Dividing both sides by 7.5:

424.4133 = 2.5 / t + 1

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

423.4133 = 2.5 / t

Now, we can solve for t:

t = 2.5 / 423.4133

t ≈ 0.0059 cm

So, the thickness of the tape is approximately 0.0059 cm."

For some reason, seems like the pipeline allocated the model on one GPU, and the tensors on another (one on ""cuda:0"", the other one on ""cuda:1"").

Let me know if this fixes the issue ? 

By multi-GPU inferencing, do you want to do data parallel inferencing, or tensor-slicing ?
Data parallelism can be done by running the script with any launcher of your choice (`torchrun/deepspeed/mpi`, just set the `current_device` correctly based on local rank, and that should work imo).

Tensor slicing is a separate problem: hard to give more info without knowing how you want to do the tensor-slicing."

Specifically for this model, adding LongRoPE support for the  128k context length and the heterogeneous block-sparsity attention makes it a bit tricky, but hopefully this should be there soon :)

DongfuJiang,2024-01-07 09:04:28+00:00,comment,llm-blender/PairRM,"Their model architecture is the same. The main difference lies in the training data and context length. 
1. For the training data:
- `pair-ranker` is the ranker trained on llm-blender/mix-instruct dataset, producing the results reported in the llm-blender paper. 
- `PairRM` is trained on `openai/summarize_from_feedback`, `lmsys/chatbot_arena_conversations`, etc. which does not contain `mix-instruct` data. (see in [PairRM README](https://huggingface.co/llm-blender/PairRM#training-datasets))
2. For the context length
There is a [simple table](https://huggingface.co/llm-blender/PairRM#context-length) comparing the this. The main difference is that `pair-ranker` constrains the source and candidate lengths to be shorter than 128, while `PairRM` can extend that constraint to 1224 and 412 respectively.

Overall, you can consider `PairRM` a more powerful version of `llm-blender/pair-ranker`.

DongfuJiang,2023-12-22 16:18:51+00:00,comment,llm-blender/PairRM,"Thank you for the question. However, PairRM contains some self-dedesigend layers and it's kind of diffucult to make it compatible with existing codes of transformer library. 

Besides, `llm-blender` also designs some simple interface functions so that PairRM can be properly used, such as `compare()`, `compare_conversations`, `best_of_n_generate`, etc.  And integrating with transformers can't provide these inferfaces. 
We also have set the minimum packages requirements to install `llm-blender` package, you can check the `setup.py` in our Github repo. Therefore, I think installing `llm-blender` won't cause too many package conflicts in the python environment.

If there are some other scenarios where installing `llm-blender` will cause conflicts, you can notice us, and see if we can resolve it."

I haven't personally used oogabooga, but generally you would want to use GPTQ or GGML for fast inference and lower vram requirements at home.

It would require ~12GB of vram, if you dont have that you will need 12GB of ram, GGML supports CPU, GPTQ/Exllama does not

It supports up to 4096 context size for new tokens, but less will keep your vram and performance in check"

You can add 32 dummy tokens to added_tokens.json to make it match the tensor size. Not sure the reason it's set up like this."

I am not a lawyer, but I am pretty sure you cannot just fine-tune a model and set a different license than the base model. (That's why everyone always says Llama-2 license instead of Apache 2.0 or MIT). Don't get me wrong, would love to try `Yi` in commercial projects! :p"

Thanks for your interest!

Yes, it is still possible to re-train the model on a completely new language! You can just fine-tune the model on the monolingual data of your target language first and then fine-tune on the parallel data. This process should give you good translation performance. But a good monolingual fine-tuning strategy could be also adding small sampling ratios for languages that ALMA already supported to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

Thanks!"

I used a model that had been already finetuned on the target language besides English by someone else to save time and resources, then added parallel data finetuning. However, this sacrifices the other language pairs by not using the base ALMA model, if that matters for your use-case."

Feel free to comment but my main question is 1) how do you explain the -10 BLEU for EN-DE vs Sota systems (I still played a lot with EN-DE) and 2) did you do human eval of your work ?
lastly did you try to apply CPO with an encoder-decoder architecture ?"
haoranxu,2024-01-19 18:01:16+00:00,comment,haoranxu/ALMA-13B-R,"Hi @vince62s  I just replied to your post before I saw this message! 
>how do you explain the -10 BLEU for EN-DE vs Sota systems

For the first question, I have replied under the post. But copied here: I also noticed the BLEU drop but improvements in the other metrics. As a Chinese speaker, I examined the test set for en->zh and found that ALMA-R provides more fluent and natural translations. I assume that the BLEU drop is due to domain mismatch with the WMT topics.

A good example from WMT’22 for en->zh:
src: I'm sorry that your order is running late.
tgt: 很抱歉，您点的餐可能会晚到一会。
ALMA-R: 对不起，您的订单延误了。

The BLEU is very low because the lexical overlapping is almost 0. But I feel ALMA-R is slightly better (because ""订单"" here is more suitable for ""order"") and they are the basically same meaning. I often find that WMT winners have nonsensically high BLEU scores, like over 64.2 for cs->en. So, I guess this is because the WMT winner for cs->en just learned very well in the domain of WMT’22.


>did you do human eval of your work ?

Regarding the human evaluation, we are doing our best to implement it in the next step.

>lastly did you try to apply CPO with an encoder-decoder architecture ?

No, we haven't done so yet, but it will be interesting to explore this :)!"

I was about to implement DPO in the repo when I saw your paper, so it seems easier to implement CPO and will do it.
Now for the results, maybe it worked fine for EN-ZH but honestly I think for EN-DE it overfitted the metric (comet). -10 Bleu is HUGE at a system level. I can understand that a sentence level this can happen but for a system I don't think so. I will be very interested to look at the human eval. Anyhow nice paper, congrats."

Do you have any update on the issue ?
Thanks a lot"

You can also finetune it with a system prompt starting off from the CroissantCoolv0.2 if you want something specific to translation that takes in sys prompts, I recommend axolotl.

Hey @Woziii ! Finally put in the time to figure out what was wrong with llamacpp model loading, it was 2 hours I probably should have spent sooner but was in so much rush these last few weeks ...
If it works out of the box for you great, if not, there's a few hacky things that can be done to patch things until I find a more stable solution !

In llama.cpp:
Replace line 3219:
```cpp
        // GGML_ASSERT(codepoints_from_utf8(word).size() > 0);
        if (codepoints_from_utf8(word).empty()) {
                    std::stringstream ss;
                    for (unsigned char c : word) {  // Ensure char is treated as unsigned
                        ss << std::hex << static_cast<int>(c) << "" "";  // Convert each byte to hex
                    }
                    LLAMA_LOG_WARN(""%s: Word '%s' at position %d could not be converted to UTF-8 codepoints and will be replaced with unk+id\n"", __func__, ss.str().c_str(), i);
                    if (i == 104) {
                        word = ""<unk_104>"";
                    } else {
                        word = ""<unk_19078>"";
                    }
                }
```

and line 3244
```cpp
vocab.linefeed_id = 106; //llama_byte_to_token(vocab, '\n');
```
In short, our tokenizer is not exactly the same as Llama's, also in terms of construction rules  and some edge cases were making tokenizer loading crash. Should be good now !
Cheers,
Manu"

Don't worry, I understand completely, it's the same for me!

Actually, the error code I mentioned comes from the same GGUF converter that I had modified to avoid going through the HF hub. Yet, your solution is interesting! I had the same deduction but it was impossible for me to patch it...

I am going to try your patch today (si j'arrive à me libérer du temps au travail) or this weekend! I hope it works!

I'll upload the GGUF files + fp16.bin files in this organization !

nielsr,2023-02-06 17:43:51+00:00,comment,microsoft/git-large-coco,"I see that you're not preparing any labels for the model. Hence it will be difficult for the model to train ;)

In your PyTorch Dataset, you prepare each image + text pair using the processor, which is great. However you also need to add a `labels` key to the `encoding` dictionary, as the model requires `pixel_values`, `input_ids`  (the prepared image + text pair) and `labels`(the ground truth targets to produce) to compute a loss. The `labels` are simply a copy of the  `input_ids`:
```
encoding[""labels""] = input_ids.copy()
```
as the model internally will shift them one position to compute the cross-entropy loss."
rubenjanss,2023-02-07 16:33:24+00:00,comment,microsoft/git-large-coco,"Ah, that makes a lot of sense and works much better, thank you!

However, now I'm wondering, does this conceptually mean that the model is trained to expect an (image, text) pair as input? Because the ""text"" in this pair is the ground truth caption. It works fine now at inference time (with only the image as input), but I'm just trying to see if I understand the concepts correctly. I'm especially confused because I already trained the BlipModelForConditionalGeneration in the same way, without providing labels, and this seemed to work fine. How is that possible?"

DiffuSeq is a conditional text generation model that adapts diffusion models to discrete signals such as text.

An intriguing property of DiffuSeq is its high diversity during generation, which is desired in many Seq2Seq tasks.
=========
DiffuSeq is a diffusion model designed for sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) text generation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first end-to-end diffusive model trained from scratch for this task. We conduct extensive experiments on a wide range of Seq2Seq tasks and find that DiffuSeq outperforms six strong baselines and even a state-of-the-art model based on pre-trained language models on all the evaluated metrics. A interesting property of DiffuSeq is its high diversity during generation, which is desired in many Seq2Seq tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis that reveals the connection between DiffuSeq and autoregressive/non-autoregressive models and show that DiffuSeq is capable of producing more diverse and better quality responses compared with the previous models by including additional priors.

=========
A new sequence to sequence text generation model, DiffuSeq, is proposed that achieves comparable or better performance than established baselines on a number of text generation tasks. The model is shown to achieve this performance through sharing the same variationallower bound from the VELA framework, however, the input and output codewords are represented as independent diffusion processes, allowing the model to capture the discrete nature of text, especially for conditional generation. The model is shown to have a intuitive connection to both autoregressive models and non-autoregressive models, and analysis of the model can be used to explain empirical results on the performance of the model.
=========
DiffuSeq is a neural network model achieving comparable or better performance than six state-of-the-art Seq2Seq models on a range of Seq2Seq tasks. The DiffuSeq model is a diffusion model, which can generate sequences by propagating a token in a one-step discrete manner. The model is evaluated on a dataset with a wide range of Seq2Seq tasks including summarization, question answering, recommendation, and language generation. The analysis reveals that the DiffuSeq model is related to autoregressive/non-autoregressive models, and the theory can help understand the empirical results of the model.

From my experiments, it is even worst. 
The model response is just a continuation of the context text, and the initial part of the output is again a copy of the original context tail."

Thanks for your interest in SEA-LION.
The SEA-LION-7b-Instruct is not fine tuned with a system prompt due to the myriad of prompts required across all 11 languages, so it might not behave as one would expect if a system prompt were to be added.
That being said, it might be possible to add additional system related prompt together with the `###USER` input prompts. Please note that this approach is not tested.

For the best result, it would be best to perform fine tuning with system prompt using the SEA-LION base model.

srowen,2023-06-28 15:31:19+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,You can do the math. 7B x 2 bytes = 14GB at least. 3 x 6GB GPUs should give you room for the model and for inference
srowen,2023-06-26 05:00:20+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"You should be able to easily find the Pythia code and paper: https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia 
But you'll see that the base Pythia 12B model's training took 72,300 A100 hours (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01373.pdf), which would cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars to reproduce.
That work goes into developing a base understanding of language that you want to reuse, not throw away and reproduce.
It also saw 200B tokens, and you would need to have something of that order of magnitude on hand to make this make sense.

It's rather the point here that outside of big orgs, this just isn't feasible; fine-tuning very much is.

But yes its training set is mostly English. Not entirely, and to a modest degree some language learning is language-agnostic.
You'd be much better served looking for another base model that covers the language of interest (what language?)
"
deepthoughts,2023-06-26 05:13:43+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"That's very informative. Thank you.

My thinking was that the model I create will be one with significantly less params ( millions) with the hope that once the language is learned, fine tuning to specific domains in that language will outperform large llms trained on an entirely different language.

I'm looking to train a model on an eastern European language. For example Ukrainian, Bulgarian, etc..."
srowen,2023-06-26 05:18:15+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Maybe; you may find that you just don't get enough language capability with a much smaller model. Another big factor here is, do you have enough Bulgarian, etc., text to support the training?
You can also just see how well off-the-shelf Pythia (or other) models understand these languages; it could be surprising. "
deepthoughts,2023-06-27 04:13:09+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,What do you think about the benefit of using the Pythia model but dumping a bunch of language-specific raw data at it to improve the quality of that particular language? I tried the model with Ukranian and Bulgarian and it's subpar as it starts conflacting languages a bit.

Yes, i just tried as you mentioned without any pip installs but  had to do for langchain as it was required. I get the below error while installing langchain libraries, i am trying to search online in parallel:

Additionally i get this error  while importing transformers pipelines

TypeError: Descriptors cannot not be created directly.
If this call came from a _pb2.py file, your generated code is out of date and must be regenerated with protoc >= 3.19.0.
If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, some other possible workarounds are:
 1. Downgrade the protobuf package to 3.20.x or lower.
 2. Set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python (but this will use pure-Python parsing and will be much slower).

Raghav93,2023-06-24 08:34:54+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"@srowen : You are right!!! Runtime already contains a lot of libraries & i never paid much attention to it. 

Some libraries are missing such as LangChain & some are not updated such as transformers which is currently 4.26.0 & for Dolly we require >=4.28.1. So, in case of missing libraries i shall ""!pip install"" them & in case of upgrading a library if necessary then i manually !pip install that one as well. Hope this is right, please feel free to correct me.

 Also, i noticed a lot of manual Pypi installs  in my cluster ""Libraries"" tab, i think this might have messed up  with the environment leading to a lot of errors. Other than internal libraries, i guess its better not to install Pypi libraries in cluster manually right? i am going to inform my team to quickly delete all the manual installations under cluster ""Libraries"" tab.

AayushShah,2023-09-28 09:56:27+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"## 🌡 Have you tried increasing the temperature?

Well try increasing the `temperature` value. I had very low temperature value along with other parameters such as `top_k` and `top_p` which made the next token distribution too steep and as the beam search's logic, you will need to have multiple tokens available, and in the **low temperature** case I couldn't have (because we know how temperature works, right?)

> So I increased the temperature and it worked. 

Try increasing the temp value and it should just work, if there are no other complexity involved."

vyasbhavin,2023-05-25 02:15:02+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Good question Sean (and good presentation on Dolly BTW a few weeks back,  was super helpful) -- my company has Goals and KPIs to measure progress towards those goals. Simplifying here, but:

Goal (for a Sales team): Increase Sales
KPI 1: New Revenue grows by x%
KPI 2: Expansion grows by y%

Goal (for a Product/Eng. Team): Clients are thrilled with our product
KPI 1: Uptime is 99.99% or higher
KPI 2: Load time is less than 2s on average

I expect a ""suggested Goals / KPIs"" based for each team type (Eng. will be diff. than Sales). Dolly (and other LLMs) are already pretty good at  giving back suggestions - I am experimenting at fine-tuning it on more specific dataset (ours) to essentially more closely resemble our language and work."
srowen,2023-05-25 02:38:47+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Maybe - you want to follow ""Goal (for a Sales team)"" by an OKR based on other KPIs that are the response? OK you could try that. The results will at best look like KPIs, but not clear it will do things you might imagine like interpolate reasonable values.

I don't know that this is a good use case for fine-tuning as much of this looks like natural language. You can consider spelling out KPI if you're worried about TLAs, but that might be in the vocab. You can instead start by manually feeding relevant goals and KPIs and prompting for a new goal and see what the answer is like. If it's good then really you just need to first retrieve similar KPIs and feed them to an off-the-shelf LLM."

The reasoning not to support every single variation of Dolly makes sense, and I'm not sure why I didn't reason that out first haha. I'll ask the GGML maintainers if they can add the files to their own [HF repository](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/ggml)."

You just need to edit out the reference to dbutils and set the choices of model, etc directly in the python code. And probably run the pip and apt installs separately, not in the python file of course. The rest is the same. 

Your first step is to get text out of the PDFs and into instruction-response strings. That's up to you.
However I don't think that is going to help if your use case is answering questions over chunks of text in PDFs, because they don't contain questions.

You should try langchain for question answering on top of PDFs and an LLM (like Dolly or others). If the results aren't ideal, try tuning the generation settings.

srowen,2023-05-05 01:36:22+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,This is just 'you sent way too much input'. Context window is 2048 and you (langchain) sent 7000+. Set verbose=True on chain to see why
MJDLPRO,2023-05-05 12:02:04+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"@srowen seems like you missed the langchain textsplitter API and I should have mentioned it. Text is sent in chunks of 700 tokens with 20 token overlap. I am not sending 7080 and every time error has a different size for 2nd value. For example, the size of tensor a stays at 2048 in this error regardless of max_length in model_kwargs i.e., max_length is 512 or 1024 but the size of tensor a stays (2048) and the size of tensor b is different each time. This case it was 7080 but other times it is 2049 or something different. Seems to be a bug in modeling_gpt_neox.py or some place you may be making use of broadcasting incorrectly? 

RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (2048) must match the size of tensor b (7080) at non-singleton dimension 3

Reference line for text splitter:
 texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

Additionally, my code snippet clearly has verbose=True and I see the error about modeling_gpt_neox.py --> 219 attn_scores = torch.where(causal_mask, attn_scores, mask_value)

Do I need to set other sizes in model_kwargs for this to work?

srowen,2023-05-03 18:38:45+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Many ways I'm sure. I'm familiar with MLflow, which helps track and then serve models. MLflow natively supports langchain and transformer models/chains, but, the support isn't _quite_ enough here because you need to bundle a vector DB like Chroma with your model too in this case, if you're not running it separately. That's fairly straightforward, just put the inference code into a class that generates predictions, and can load the vector DB from an artifact that was logged with the model. I don't have a worked example, but it's fairly easy to piece together. Then mlflow can serve it for you. Databricks has built-in serving built around MLflow too, but you don't have to use that of course."

1. currently, I use my data(20 files) to create embedding from HuggingFaceEmbeddings. Even if I have 2 millions files do I need to follow the same steps like 1.create embedding from HuggingFaceEmbeddings, 2. do similarity test, and 3. pass it to model?
2. At what stage I need to retrain the LLM? 
3. is it possible to retrain the LLM with my own data?
4. currently, your notebook show chromadb as vector db, In case if I want to move it production how do I host it? where do I store all my data(embeddings)? do I need to store all embedding in any database, if yes, could you please recommend any?
5. how do I evaluated dolly LLM with my data?
6. currently, I noticed dolly model with my data gives one wrong answer. so, how do I correct the model? if it is other model like text classification I would correct the label and retrain the model with corrected label. how do I do it here?"
srowen,2023-05-03 21:55:46+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"If you're following the langchain question-answering chain pattern, you do need to create a vector DB with your text embedded into it. But langchain is doing much of the rest. You've tried the example? you can see what your code has to do.

This pattern does not involve fine-tuning an LLM at all.

You can simply bundle the chroma DB files and try to deploy them with your model. It's fixed, won't change, but that's simple. Otherwise you set up a stand-alone vector DB service (not Chroma) and call that.

Hard to say how to evaluate it. Depends on what you are doing.

You can't correct models directly. You can improve training data, maybe."

Could you tell me if there are requirements specifically for system RAM?

I decided to experimentally run in a base colab (I know I need a more powerful processor, but I wanted to make sure everything runs for me) and found that the training could not continue due to the system's RAM being full.

srowen,2023-04-25 12:44:07+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Yes it's a fine and standard idea. You could also simply use an embedding that produces smaller dimensions in the first place. The downside is that you must apply the whole PCA to new inputs too. It also may not gain as much speed as one might expect as vector operations are already highly parallel on GPUs.

What I'm not super sure about is how much that affects the quality of the embedding. You are retaining most of the variance (it may not be 10 dimensions in all cases, note, that have 'most' of the variance) but losing some information. PCA preserves the inner product, IIRC, but this is also PCA on uncentered data. I don't remember enough to evaluate how it affects cosine distance (doesn't?) or Euclidean (does?). So I think it's an open question how much computation it costs and what the downsides are, but yes fine idea."
NewsSoup,2023-04-26 14:35:09+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Sorry for the late reply, new accounts can only comment once a day.

For ordinary training the PCA would do nothing, because it amounts to rotating the embeddings around the origin until you finds an ordered list of directions with decreasing spread of information.

However, the PCA can reveal how many dimensions carry meaningful information and how many can be cut off when making a distil model.

For semantic search you do not need to train a transformer either (since PCA amounts to a rotation of the embedding vectors). 

It is only useful for taking a large model and using it to train a smaller parameter model. PCA could reveal the minimum amount of embedding dimensions you can get away with, given any specific parent model.

In other words, language models draw shapes in random orientations, but if you align those shapes you can see where the flesh is and which parts of the shape contribute little."
srowen,2023-04-26 15:04:59+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"I get it, but, PCA is minimizing distance to a hyperplane in the embedding space, which is a transformation that is not necessarily compatible with the semantics of how the embedding space is used. In particular you typically do not use Euclidean distance, but cosine similarity. It's probably 'pretty fine' in practice, but that is the reason it's not obviously the right thing to do.

Compare that to simply using a smaller embedding too, which does not need a transform applied at runtime."
NewsSoup,2023-05-31 21:02:37+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"So in hind sight, a different algorithm for PCA is the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In LLM language you should recognise that as the same algorithm used by LoRA (low rank adaptation). Turns out we were using it already, by a different name.

The standard algorithm for PCA is the eigen-decomposition of the covariance, but multiplying the left two matrices of the SVD produces the same output as the eigen-decomposition - so they are equivalent, being related by either a factorisation or a multiplication."

I'm following this  https://www.dbdemos.ai/demo-notebooks.html?demoName=llm-dolly-chatbot. At the very last step its mentioned that optimum will improve inference greatly so use that to enhance inference speed. I'm using it as 

          tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(input_model, padding_side=""left"")
          model = ORTModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(""databricks/dolly-v2-3b"", export=True, provider=""CUDAExecutionProvider"")

I get the following error:

It enhanced inference speed by 1-2s. Earlier it took 3-4s to generate answers to simple questions like ""What is product?"" But it takes 34GB memory to run dolly in onnx format. I think that's too much to run a smaller model. Earlier it was taking 6-7GB. Any pointers on this? I've been stuck for a long time on this step, which prevents me from moving forward to the next step. I want to build a chatbot to which I feed lots of books and then use it for my customers.

edubz,2023-04-19 20:07:48+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Hi there, you've got a few items to unpack here. First, you want to point to a more recent version of the transformers SDK, ideally one that has support for all of the model objects needed for dolly. 

Second, this is a 12B parameter model. That means you are likely going to need more than one accelerator to host it. I'm testing this out on my end now, and will report back soon what seems to be the smallest number of accelerators. If you're compiling it, you need fewer.

Third, I would point to a hosting instance that uses accelerators, either inferentia (inf1) or NVIDIA (g's or p's).

I'll respond in a bit with more concrete guidance. In the meantime, Phillip has some great examples of doing this end-to-end here!

I've been playing with EC2 directly—no SageMaker—and `dolly-v2-12b` runs fine on a `p3.2xlarge` instance (quick enough for my experiments, anyway!) running the following script:

hf_pipeline = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=generate_text)

llm_context_chain = LLMChain(llm=hf_pipeline, prompt=prompt_with_context)

context = """"""George Washington (February 22, 1732 - December 14, 1799) was an American military officer, statesman,

Now, back to SageMaker: I've then updated dependency versions as per the comments above, and I'm now getting a new error regarding running out of disk space. I'm using the following code:

https://gist.github.com/timesler/4b244a6b73d6e02d17fd220fd92dfaec

@alvaropp I believe the issue with running out of disk space was because the 512GB disk mount on SageMaker is at `/home/ec2-user/SageMaker`, but HuggingFace libraries default to storing files in a cache at `/home/ec2-user/.cache/...`. The solution is to set the `HF_HOME` env var to a location under  `/home/ec2-user/SageMaker`. Importantly, if you set the env var in python, make sure you do it _before_ importing HuggingFace libraries to make sure it gets used. I've included that in the linked gist.

To get the 12b model running on a `g5.4xlarge` instance, I think you'll also need to set `load_in_8bit` to `True`."

A discussion about sourcing part PN569 for the company's project took place on 2nd January. The companies that were considered were Intel, Bungie and SK Hynix. Intel has better technical support. Intel has very long waits for delivery and poor customer service. Unprofessional behavior exhibited by the Intel representative. SK Hynix is a proven supplier with established quality standards. Storage is easier to integrate with existing systems. Bungie has a quicker turnaround time and bigger budget. Bungie has great customer service. Bungie's representatives are very professional and courteous. The senior manager spoke of his experience of twenty years of working with Intel and that the downsides of working with Intel are a phenomenon of recent months and hence shouldn't be considered while making a decade-long plan.

Summarize the supplier Intel.

Intel is the preferred supplier for the project as they have the best technical support, better customer service and better turnaround time. They have a reputation of unprofessional behavior and their representatives are not professional and courteous."

chainyo,2023-04-20 13:53:44+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"I saw this tokenizer parameter, but it is useless. Keeping this number during tokenization means there is no `max_length`, which is false because you will get an error if you try to feed the EleutherAI base model with an input that is more than `5120` tokens.

Dolly v2 12B seems to be fine-tuned on 2048 tokens inputs, so now the model accepts a maximum of 2048 tokens even if the `hidden_size` layer is still 5120.

The problem I'm trying to understand is why I keep getting an input tensor of 2049 when I specify a max_length of 2048 to my tokenizer. 🤗

This I honestly don't quite know, but I'm aware that this setting has caused some questions: https://huggingface.co/databricks/dolly-v2-12b/blob/main/tokenizer_config.json#L5 Seems like it should be lower, and we've discussed this elsewhere. But I wonder if you somehow need to set `model_max_length` instead to 1024? this is new territory for me but it's a decent next guess"
michael-newsrx-com,2023-05-02 13:22:55+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Yes, the tokens I'm submitting are 1998 in size, when combined with the built-in prompt and chained output exceed the 2048 limit.

I tried that, after creating the object, it seems to ignore that as well. I'm a bit perplexed trying to figure out to configure the tokenizer to actually do this.

I'm trying to decipher the InstructPipeline this morning to see if I can find a way to properly trim the instruction and context to a length that takes into account the pipeline injected prompt and the max new tokens output count."
michael-newsrx-com,2023-05-02 13:55:28+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"So, based on my lack of progress, I'm guessing I'll need to truncate manually to some max value < 2048 based on my max output desired."

I use:
- Databricks Runtime Version: 13.0 ML (includes Apache Spark 3.4.0, Scala 2.12)
- Worker type: Standard_NC4as_T4_v3, 28 GB Memory, 1 GPU, Min workers 2, Max workers 8

Is that compute too small?"
srowen,2023-04-18 13:08:50+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"It is not sufficient on several counts.
You are trying to tune the 12B model which needs A100 GPUs.
You can tune 7B/3B with A10 or V100, but you have T4s.
28GB of OS RAM is too little unless maybe using the 3B model.
You have a cluster, but do not need a cluster - single node.

But here is some documentation about how it reasons about memory: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/deepspeed#memory-requirements May not be the issue, but may be that you have to configure HF or deepspeed differently to have it load on different GPUs.

You can get it to run on the T4 if you load in 8-bit instead.
You can also just use a smaller model, like the 6.9B param version of Dolly 2.

I recommend A10 instances (g5). The 12B model works with 8-bit, and loads the smaller models just fine. Note you should add torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16 for A10 or A100s. 
A100s certainly work."

What's confusing me still is that if the EOS token was not configured correctly then the model would be generating the EOS token and then continuing to generate after it. However the model isn't outputting the EOS token (### End) or the token_id for it. 

I have tried the smaller model without quantisation and it seemed to work as expected (generating the eos token and stopping generation) however the quantized 12b model just never generated the EOS token. 

I wonder if its some issue with the quantization"

mike-conover-db,2023-04-13 15:11:59+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Hey Daniel, I’m one of the creators of Dolly and wanted to share some of our thinking on this. 

Flan-T5 is really powerful and the Flan dataset particularly so. The thing I observe when using it is for tasks like open ended content generation etc is that it’s very terse. I’ve never been able to get it to write a multi paragraph letter, for example.

My hypothesis is that this reflects the composition of the underlying completion dataset, which is as you mention composed of a lot of benchmark-style responses, eg rate the sentiment, reply w categories or selections from a multiple choice list.  To me it seems like it’s great on understanding oriented problems, but not really performant for text generation broadly, which is one of the characteristics I think about when I think of instruction following.

Secondly, I agree, and we debated how to say this without using a million hyphens, but we worked to communicate that the Dolly dataset is the first human-generated open instruction tuning corpus specifically designed to elicit this behavior.  To the best of my (admittedly limited) knowledge there are  other corpora like OIG, Flan, p3, super natural instructions etc - but they all are either synthetic in the style of self instruct, scraped from the web (as in the case of much of the Flan data) or governed by restrictive licenses.

The last thing we want is to ruin a good time by claiming something that’s not true, and this is a big part of why we go to lengths to emphasize, for example, that the model isn’t state of the art.  That said, at least for now I do believe this a first, but like any reasonable scientist remain open to new information as it becomes available.

Thanks for your interest in the project, and hope you find it interesting and useful. 

Take care,
Mike"

matthayes,2023-04-13 06:33:45+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"In general it cannot generate text in non-English languages very well.  The base model was primarily trained on English text.  However, there is still going to be some non-English text in the corpus.  For example, there are web pages in English that teach you German expressions.  Due to this reason the  model may sometimes learn an association between some English and another language.  You might find some cases where it will translate some basic phrases okay due to this assocation, but I wouldn't rely on the model for this purpose.  I've tested Dolly v1 in these scenarios and it tends to make up sentences that kind of look like German but aren't correct."

matthayes,2023-04-13 06:12:51+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"If you are using a runtime like `12.2 LTS ML (includes Apache Spark 3.3.2, GPU, Scala 2.12)` in Databricks then you just need to pip install those two dependencies.  Actually I think transformers is likely already installed by default for that runtime.  So you might just need to pip install accelerate.   You don't need to clone the repo or set up a virtual environment.  The Databricks cluster already sets up a venv for you with most packages  you'd need already installed.   So steps 1 and 2 you list are not necessary.  If you copy and paste the code from step 4 into a cell and run it then it should just work.  The Hugging Face libraries will download everything you need, including the model.  Hope that helps."

dfurman,2023-04-13 11:56:22+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,Yes - the model should have thrown a warning when you feed in a chunk that is larger than the window size but instead it just errors out. You should explicitly add the max window size in that variable (seems the Dolly-v1 model did have this correct).
dfurmanWMP,2023-04-27 16:54:48+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"@matthayes. This is still erred and should be hard-coded in to whatever the window size is for the model (I think it is 2048 based on initial testing). It is important because people can use the truncation functionality when tokenizing - so that when you feed in a chunk larger than the window size, the model doesn't just err out.

matthayes,2023-04-27 17:27:35+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"If you look at the source for `TextGenerationPipeline` (which our pipeline is somewhat derived from), it has an option `handle_long_generation`:

```
            handle_long_generation (`str`, *optional*):
                By default, this pipelines does not handle long generation (ones that exceed in one form or the other
                the model maximum length). There is no perfect way to adress this (more info
                :https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/14033#issuecomment-948385227). This provides common
                strategies to work around that problem depending on your use case.

                - `None` : default strategy where nothing in particular happens
                - `""hole""`: Truncates left of input, and leaves a gap wide enough to let generation happen (might
                  truncate a lot of the prompt and not suitable when generation exceed the model capacity)
```

We could do something similar, where basically we truncate the instruction before it is formatted into the full prompt.  This isn't a perfect solution but could be an okay workaround."

matthayes,2023-04-27 17:33:24+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,">so we should basically set it to 1769?

At the moment if you are using the `InstructionTextGenerationPipeline` as is I think you should truncate the text before passing it into the pipeline.  Unfortunately it is a bit tricky to know what you should truncate it to, as you don't know the length until you tokenize it.  You could tokenize, truncate, decode, and pass that into the pipeline.  If you are customizing `InstructionTextGenerationPipeline` then I suggest truncating the instruction preprocess before it is formatted, and derive the max length from 2048 - length of prompt - max_new tokens.  You could get the prompt length by computing the length of `PROMPT_FOR_GENERATION_FORMAT.format(instruction="""")` for example."

The model appears to load correctly, but the RAM quickly saturates to 100% with the VRAM consumption idling on 2GB (Windows and background apps). I am using the GPU version of torch and set the CUDA device ID to force use of the GPU, torch also correctly identifies the CUDA device. Is more RAM required either way to first load in the model, prior to model being transferred to the GPU? Or is the model loaded into RAM either way with the inference running solely on the GPU (i.e. time for a RAM upgrade :) )?"

Who is Dalai?
 Baba Ram Dass: Who am I? That is a good question. I am not sure who I am. Some people think that I am a Buddhist, although I am not. I am not even certain what that is. I do know that I have a great curiosity about who I am, where I am from, and where am I going. I don't know where I came from, but I know where I'm going. So who am I?


[Note: In the early 1970's, Ram Dass was given the name Richard Alpert.  He was an American psychologist who was part of a team of researchers who conducted experiments on consciousness through the use of mind-altering drugs.  Through these experiments, Alpert discovered something called ""set and setting"".  According to Alpert, our consciousness is affected not by what we are consciously aware of, but rather by the context of our awareness.  In other words, our beliefs and expectations influence our experience of the world around us.  Through his experiments with psychedelic drugs, Alpert came to believe that the source of these beliefs and expectations was our spiritual consciousness, or soul.  Through the use of certain chants and prayers, Alpert was able to ""re-channel"" his soul, leading him to abandon his work with the Harvard Psilocybin Project and to change his name to Ram Dass.]

[Note: The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was a Tibetan Buddhist religious and political leader who was forced into exile following a failed 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule.  His Holiness was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times between 1974 and 1990, and was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2001.  Since 1959, the Dalai Lama has lived in northern India, where he has worked to preserve and promote the Tibetan language and culture.  His main teaching is that a stable and just society is based on individual ethics

langchain can help you build this on top of an LLM, helping you look up context relevant to the question and stuff it in a prompt for you automatically, before passing to the LLM."

You would have to extract the text from a document first in order to feed it into a prompt. Langchain has some related tools here for extracting text chunks from PDFs, etc that might come in handy, alongside all the other things it does. But you could extract the text however you can.

There are many reasons it could be slow, but should be more like seconds on a large GPU. It's hard to say without knowing how you are using it on what hardware. Like, if you are running on CPU only, yes it will take forever. See the github repo for more information https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly"

Either way, this might cause trouble in the future:
If you get `CUDA error: invalid device function` errors, the above might be the cause and the solution is to make sure only one ['libcudart.so', 'libcudart.so.11.0', 'libcudart.so.12.0'] in the paths that we search based on your env.

srowen,2023-04-20 18:39:14+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Yeah, that's all working - it's just that the model hits overflow on that input in 8-bit. This can happen. IIRC this seemed to happen on the V100, not A10, but may be just coincidence. Try an A10, or a smaller model."
srowen,2023-04-12 19:03:21+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,This means you didn't install `accelerate`.  See https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly for more notes on generation
Vivi95,2023-04-12 19:22:53+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"@srowen that's right. I had to restart the kernel. But now it's this error

srowen,2023-04-12 19:31:09+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,What version of transformers are you using? You may need to update.
Vivi95,2023-04-12 19:52:35+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"I just updated it and still the same error. Note, I am running it in mac m1 @srowen 
Name: transformers
Version: 4.27.4"
srowen,2023-04-12 19:56:13+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"I doubt this will work on a Mac, like most any model that relies on CUDA. This error is probably telling you that at some level, but often comes up if you don't have pytorch installed, too. The repo here shows how to use the model, but you will generally need a powerful NVIDIA GPU for good results."
srowen,2023-04-12 16:47:34+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Yes. See the Github repo associated with this model: https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly You can simply supply a different data set in the same format, to fine-tune the base model differently."
vhh23,2023-04-12 19:04:27+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Should we use type as ""classification"" if we just want to give data as a pre training data ?"
srowen,2023-04-12 19:05:56+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"No, this is not a classification model. It is a text-generation model. See the repo for the full training script and more information."

matthayes,2023-04-20 18:39:09+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"@ammontenegrod no it is based on the Pythia model, which is pretrained on English text from The Pile.

srowen,2023-04-20 18:39:50+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"You might find it has some non-English tokens and works a little bit, from snippets of non-English language in the training data, but generally no."
Chintan-Donda,2023-05-22 09:49:34+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"Can we use this model for 'question-answering' task?

For ex:
task=""question-answering""

model, tokenizer = load_model_tokenizer_for_generate(input_model='databricks/dolly-v2-3b')
llm = HuggingFacePipeline(
    pipeline=InstructionTextGenerationPipeline(

This model is using `AutoModelForCausalLM`.  Can we use `AutoModelForQuestionAnswering` when retraining the model?"
srowen,2023-05-22 11:45:32+00:00,comment,databricks/dolly-v2-12b,"(Please use new threads for new questions)
question-answering means extractive QA, and no it is not that type of model. You can answer questions, but not in the sense of that task."
