it did much of it pretty seamlessly and then we enhanced it to handle various other scenarios.

srowen,2024-04-10 12:31:08+00:00,comment,databricks/dbrx-instruct,"Saving to /dbfs is saving to cloud storage, so it's slower than local disk, though that sounds a lot slower than expected. Is the storage in question mounted from another region?

I think this is a question about Hugging Face's cache. Its dir structure is not the same as the model's file and folder structure, it has more to it. You do not use the cache dirs directly anyway though.

Yes, you can `save_pretrained` to wherever you like, including a /dbfs path, and load that path back. This is not related to the cache.

I'm not sure what error you encountered. Saving shouldn't involve doing anything with GPUs. It's possible you are having problems loading the model to begin with, before saving it. Here we don't have context about how you load or into what type of instance (GPUs? enough RAM?)"
twony,2024-04-12 10:31:28+00:00,comment,databricks/dbrx-instruct,"Thanks again for the advice. I've reproduced the error and the message is below. Seems to be caused by an attempt to move tensors to cpu. Note that I'm on a single node GPU ""cluster"" (48 cores) so maybe there's no cpu available for this step. 

[EDITED]: Nearly all of the model is saved before hitting this error. We get the two jsons (config and generation_config) and 34 out of 36 safetensor files.

Steps were:
(1) set the env variable to use local_disk0 for caching
(2) download dbrx straight from huggingface using model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(""databricks/dbrx-instruct"", etc.
(3) save a copy of the model in dbfs, giving it a dbfs filepath in model.save_pretrained(model_path)

It's worth noting that the save-out fails after 34 tensors, whether attempting to save into dbfs or local_disk0

DBFS is cloud storage, virtually infinite. /local_disk0 is elastic local storage, will go to tens of terabytes, so not the issue either.
The error is not related to disk storage.

Out of curiosity, why do this vs use the Foundation Model API, if you're on Databricks?"

srowen,2024-04-03 12:20:44+00:00,comment,databricks/dbrx-instruct,"You would have to get the tokenizer files to the machine using it, somehow, at least once. After that, by default `transformers` caches the files locally. You can also copy the files by other means, then load a tokenizer by pointing at the local directory containing the files. In this respect it's not different than other tokenizers. This model uses tiktoken, in particular, if that helps."

"
srowen,2024-04-03 15:12:22+00:00,comment,databricks/dbrx-instruct,"Disk space != RAM. That has nothing to do with RAM.

First, you need the RAM on one machine, not across machines across a cluster. This does not distribute in this way. You want one big single-node 'cluster' in Databricks. But this is not the issue.

I assume you're just letting Hugging Face download and cache the model. By default it saves copies of the model files in a location under ~/.cache. In Databricks, the root volume of machines is not large (100GB? IIRC?) because you generally don't directly use significant disk space in workloads.  However, the attached autoscaling local storage is very large, and gets bigger, as that is what Spark itself uses for local storage. That's the storage mounted under `/local_disk0` (at least on AWS, think it's the same on Azure). You can tell HF to use a path under there to cache by setting the env variable `HF_HUB_CACHE` to such a path, in your notebook, before you import `transformers`.

That's still transient storage. If you want to avoid downloading from HF every time, you can instead use a path on persistent distributed storage as the cache. This would be DBFS or Unity Catalog volumes; `/dbfs/...` or `/Volumes/...` paths. Same idea, you set `HF_HUB_CACHE` to such a path. The upside is that the cache is persistent; the downside is that  it's still not locally attached storage, so the initial upload is slower, and not as fast to load from local disk later because it's copying from object storage. Still may be faster and more reliable than HF downloads, and saves HF's servers some load!"

Sorry, I just saw the previously closed thread...

I'm having the same issue, but my machine has 4 x A6000 Ada 48gb GPUs (combined 192 total VRAM) and 512 gb of RAM for CPU. Am I not able to run this model? Is there like a quantized version of it, or some way I can get it to fit?

Much of the model could load in 192GB, but there would be a perf hit as at least some would be offloaded to CPU. device_map=""auto"" is doing that here, almost surely. You can do a sense check with nvidia-smi (your mem is likely ~100% full), and calling `.hf_device_map` on the loaded model to see which devices have loaded which layers, and which are on CPU if any (and I expect some are)

You can check out third-party 4-bit quantizations like https://huggingface.co/PrunaAI/dbrx-instruct-bnb-4bit for example"

Can i understand that the input tokens are generated?

Next:
outputs = model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=200)
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:100257 for open-end generation.
And now no output and the cell is running for hours...

Please explain."
srowen,2024-04-01 01:05:30+00:00,comment,databricks/dbrx-instruct,"While you can run on CPU, it will be very slow. I suspect you are actually swapping, if this loads; I don't see how else this can work in just 32GB of memory. That would make it very very slow.
At the least, you should try a high-mem instance with (say) 300GB+ of RAM if you want to explore this."

hanlintang,2024-03-29 15:16:59+00:00,comment,databricks/dbrx-instruct,"Hello @elysiia , we generally recommend fine-tuning the base model. There are many excellent finetuning libraries out there -- e.g. [axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) by @winglian, the huggingface trainer itself, and others. We have an open source library as well that include some finetuning examples (e.g. see https://github.com/databricks/DBRX?tab=readme-ov-file#finetune, which has configs for both full parameter finetuning and LoRa-based finetuning of DBRX). These examples will include details on how to format the dataset."
Ateeqq,2024-03-29 16:59:51+00:00,comment,databricks/dbrx-instruct,"As @hanlintang  said, fine-tuning the base model is the best option. You can also use Hugging Face's AutoTrain Feature to easily fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on your own Question Answering Dataset.

I also recommend reviewing this article ([https://exnrt.com/blog/ai/finetune-llms-with-huggingface/](https://exnrt.com/blog/ai/finetune-llms-with-huggingface/)) to understand all the theoretical and technical guidance related to fine-tuning.

## Choosing the Right DBRX Model for Fine-Tuning

Here's how to decide between the base and instruction-tuned DBRX model for your task:

**Opt for the base model (databricks/dbrx-base) if:**

* Your task requires learning general semantic representations from scratch specific to your domain. This is because the base model is trained on a broader dataset and can learn these general representations more effectively.

**Choose the instruction-tuned model (databricks/dbrx-instruct) if:**

* Your task heavily relies on following instructions within the context to generate responses. The instruction-tuned model is pre-trained on a dataset of instruction following tasks, giving it a head start in this area.

## Prompt Template for Training Data

Here's a template you can use to format your training data for fine-tuning the DBRX model:

```
data_example = [
    {
        ""instruction"": ""Summarize the following article"",
        ""context"": ""This is a long article about..."",
        ""question"": ""What is the main idea of the article?"",
        ""response"": ""The main idea of the article is...""
    },
    # Add more examples...
]
```

Each data point in your list should be a dictionary with the following keys:

* **instruction:** The instruction you want the model to follow.
* **context:** The context to which the instruction applies.
* **question:** The question you want the model to answer based on the instruction and context.
* **response:** The desired answer to the question.

By adding more examples with various instructions, contexts, questions, and responses, you can enrich your training data and improve the fine-tuned model's performance on your specific task.

Would be nice if we could get some way to do this officially. Otherwise, I imagine someone will upload a model with these changes, and lots of people will just use that version, as you can train LoRA on it etc. Alternatively, bitsandbytes and PEFT would have to add explicit support somehow for the current fused weight architecture."

Otherwise, I imagine someone will upload a model with these changes, and lots of people will just use that version, as you can train LoRA on it etc. Alternatively, bitsandbytes and PEFT would have to add explicit support somehow for the current fused weight architecture.

In my case, it works quite well. I literally only change nn.Parameter into nn.Linear. Even when load it in cpu without quantization and generate using it, the generation result is no different with this repo."

I think you have to update your torch. Because that error implied that `nn.LayerNorm` has no `bias` parameter in its init method. But, from torch documentation [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LayerNorm.html), clearly `bias` exists there."

I guess this could be a improvement for next version, looking forward to new versions and maybe smaller ones too :3

When I provide a question, I get infinite random characters as the result (see screenshot). But when I create a local model from the same quantized gguf by using Modelfile for Ollama inference, then everything works fine. So the issue is that Ollama works, and llama-cpp-python provides random output. The same behavior was noticed with a couple other models, like defog/llama-3-sqlcoder-8b.

@liashchynskyi  Yes!  I'm having the same issue with `defog/llama-3-sqlcoder-8b`.  I'm using LangChain with `llama-cpp-python` - only GGUF models.  I'm looking to use GGUF files others have created - I can look into generating my own if that's the only solution.

Output from `defog/llama-3-sqlcoder-8b`:

Q2_K, Q3_K_L, Q3_K_M, Q3_K_S: These appear to specify a version or configuration of the model. ""Q"" might stand for ""Quarter"" or another relevant metric, followed by a number that could indicate a version number or a sequence. ""K"" might represent a specific configuration or feature, and ""L"", ""M"", ""S"" might indicate different sizes or performance levels (e.g., Large, Medium, Small).
Q4_0, Q4_1: Here, ""Q4"" might similarly indicate a version of the model, with the following numbers ""0"" and ""1"" potentially representing different iterations or variants of that version.
Q5_0, Q5_1, Q5_K_M, Q5_K_S: Similarly, ""Q5"" represents another version, with ""0"" and ""1"" possibly being different iterations, and ""K_M"" and ""K_S"" indicating specific configurations or sizes.
Q6_K, Q8_0: These are different version numbers again, with ""Q6"" and ""Q8"" potentially marking two different points in a sequence, and ""K"" and ""0"" possibly signifying specific configurations or iterations."
iyadycb,2024-04-19 03:31:31+00:00,comment,QuantFactory/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF,"They are different levels of quantization.
Smaller Q numbers indicate heavier quantization (i.e. greater quality loss) but with reduced memory usage. K means it's using llama.cpp's K-type quants. For example, Q4_0 is using an older quant method.
The S, M, L (small, medium, large) just means more or lessquantization within that same level (e.g. Q3_K_S is quantized more heavily Q3_K_L).
I'm not an expert in this field but I hope you get the idea."

> The fine-tuned models were trained for dialogue applications. To get the expected features and performance for them, a specific formatting defined in ChatFormat needs to be followed: The prompt begins with a <|begin_of_text|> special token, after which one or more messages follow. Each message starts with the <|start_header_id|> tag, the role system, user or assistant, and the <|end_header_id|> tag. After a double newline \n\n the contents of the message follow. The end of each message is marked by the <|eot_id|> token. 

So, i use like:
`./main -m ~/models/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q8_0.gguf --color -n -2 -e -s 0 -p '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHi!<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n' -ngl 99 --mirostat 2 -c 8192 -r '<|eot_id|>' --in-prefix '\n<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n' --in-suffix '<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n' -i`

I tested your foundational non-Instruct Q5_K_M with the same GPT4All v2.7.3 app and prompts and it stops after completing a response.

Then I re-tested the Instruct and it stops as it should after non-alignment prompts. But when alignment it triggered during by my alignment prompts (e.g. make a list of cuss words) it gives an I can't do that response and never ends.

> 
> are you planning to fix the tokenizer config (see https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/discussions/2 )? I don't know what the actual llama-3 repo does.

I read there are a few PRs in llama.cpp to adapt the way llama3 uses bpe tokens.
I just did this quick hacky fix I found I don't expect this is a real solution though.

Problem: Llama-3 uses 2 different stop tokens, but llama.cpp only has support for one.
The reason that the <|end_of-text|> did not work is a llama.cpp thing, I see some guys working to add support now.

So the config template is using the <|eot_id|> which is why modifying these will solve the endless generation... (before llama.cpp is fixed)
special_tokens_map.json value ""eos_token"" to ""<|eot_id|>"" 
tokenizer_config.json value of ""eos_token"" to ""<|eot_id|>""

Maybe this is irrelevant now... I did this before they updated the template today."

（1）Both models are pretrained models.
（2）Compared to InternLM2-7B-Base(InternLM2-20B-Base), InternLM2-7B(InternLM2-20B) includes additional domain-enhanced data and has undergone further pretraining. It does not contain chat-specific corpora, and we have made every effort to ensure there is no data leakage.
（3）We are currently preparing a technical report to thoroughly explain the differences between these models.

Regarding the issue with `accelerate` library in GPU memory computation, it's important to note that offloading is actually unnecessary when there is ample GPU memory available (80GB * 8). Please refer to my previous response for more details."

I am doing some experiments using the GGML version now.
But struggling to understand why the approach using AutoModelForCausalLM from ctransformers gives a different result than using CTransformers from LangChain... Same prompt different results.

AutoModelForCausalLM is more close to what I am looking for, just need to figure out what causes the difference...

And using Git for large files results in storing twice as much data as needed, because Git LFS stores all the data twice - once in the filename, and again in the `blobs` directory.  So if you git clone one of my GGML repos you'll end up with hundreds of gigabytes of data you don't ever use :)

Use `wget` to grab the file you want - or any download client.

Or if you want to do it from Python code, you can use `hf_hub_download` from `huggingface_hub`, like this:
```
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
hf_hub_download(repo_id='TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML',  filename='llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin')
```

I should start adding that info to my GGML repos.

If you do plan to do inference from Python,  you don't need to download the file manually at all - you can use the `ctransformers` Python library for  GGML inference, and that automatically downloads the GGML file you specify.  There's a link to ctransformers in the README.

I was using the llama.cpp instructions to convert models to gguf format. It works perfectly with original meta-llama2-7B model, but had the problems when converting QLoRA trained model (after merging). I was using OVH Cloud tutorial and notebook for the QLoRA fine-tuning. https://blog.ovhcloud.com/fine-tuning-llama-2-models-using-a-single-gpu-qlora-and-ai-notebooks/

First step: use llama.cpp convert.py to convert model to F16. There was one error

> ""Could not find tokenizer.model in models/ovh7b or its parent"".

So I copied the tokenizer.model from original meta-llama2-7B model files. Then the convert script works correctly.

Then I quantize to q4.0 and it also worked.

But when I use llama.cpp to do intereference, I got the error of

> error loading model: create_tensor: tensor 'output_norm.weight' not found
> llama_load_model_from_file: failed to load model
> llama_init_from_gpt_params: error: failed to load model 'models/ovh7b/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf'"

With the recent move to GGUF i started experimenting with doing it myself. Basically 'self empowerment' for the next time they change formats on us. And watching what you were doing, helped greatly in that venture.
 
Originally i honestly did not think i had the resources ( stuck with an older 12gb vGPU titan, fried my 24gb tesla ), but the conversion+quantization is not bad at all and only takes a few minutes on my non GPU machine, for a 13B model. ( training, forget it, unless i lease GPU time.. ).

They have done a great job on making it use as little RAM as possible.  Pretty much any PC can make GGUFs, even of big models like 70B.

@komal-09 Assuming you compiled or downloaded already-compiled binaries, then on Windows it would be `quantize.exe`rather than `./quantize` "

It will have main.exe, quantize.exe, and everything else. No need to build it yourself.

If you have an NVidia GPU, pick the `cu11.7.1` version if you use CUDA toolkit 11.x, or `cu12.1.0` version if you use CUDA toolkit 12.x.  

If you don't have an NVidia GPU or don't plan to use it, pick `llama-b1215-bin-win-avx2-x64.zip`  if you have a modern CPU, or `llama-b1215-bin-win-avx-x64.zip` if you have an old CPU (more than 7+ years old)"

Have you confirmed that makes a practical difference?"
mike-ravkine,2023-07-19 23:18:55+00:00,comment,TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML,"@TheBloke

This should apply equally to GPTQ.  The things that look like special tokens here are not actually special tokens, its just been finetuned out the wazoo with this very specific template:

```
 System: Respond with the main characters of the given movie. User: Guardians of the Galaxy Assistant: *Star-Lord (Peter Quill) *Gamora *Drax the Destroyer *Rocket Raccoon *Groot *Baby Groot Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification. [end of text]
```

```
 <s>[INST]<<SYS>>Respond with the main characters of the given movie<</SYS>> Guardians of the Galaxy[/INST]  Sure! Here are the main characters of the movie Guardians of the Galaxy:

1. Peter Quill / Star-Lord (played by Chris Pratt): A human who was abducted by aliens as a child and grew up to be a skilled thief and smuggler. He is the leader of the Guardians.
2. Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana): A green-skinned alien who is a skilled warrior and assassin. She is the adopted daughter of Thanos, the mad Titan who seeks to conquer the universe.
3. Drax the Destroyer (played by Dave Bautista): A powerful warrior who seeks revenge against Ronan the Accuser for killing his family. He is a humanoid with cybernetic implants and enhanced strength.
4. Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper): A genetically engineered raccoon who is a skilled fighter and weapons expert. He is sarcastic and has a troubled past.
5. Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel): A tree-like humanoid who can control plants and has superhuman strength. He is able to say only three words: ""I am Groot.""
6. Mantis (played by Pom Klementieff): A sensitive and empathetic alien who can sense the emotions of others. She serves as a companion and confidant to Peter Quill. [end of text]

The leading `<s>` doesn't seem to make any difference in the few single-turn prompts I've run but I have no idea if those `</s><s>` pairs get more relevant once you get deeper into a conversation. "

Mikael110,2023-07-18 22:58:57+00:00,comment,TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML,"That is similar to my conclusion about the format, but as far as my understanding of the code goes the system message is attached to the first prompt, rather than standing on it's own. Meaning the first [INST] block contains both the system message and the first instruction. Then all subsequent [INST] blocks contain only the instruction.

That also matches with the understanding that [asgeir](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/2262#issuecomment-1640795572) and [jxy](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/2262#issuecomment-1641063329) independently came up with which suggest it is probably correct.

Either way the current prompt template displayed in the model card is definitively wrong. @TheBloke it would be nice if you could replace it quickly since there will be a lot of people trying out these models right now."

SbS тоже полезен, но хотелось бы еще какую-то более общую метрику. Не сказать, чтобы в восторге от MERA, но что есть и локально можно тест провести, правда для оценки все равно отправлять...
Кстати ruMMLU верна в какой-то степени коррелирует с позицией в SbS. Было бы интересно в SbS с оригинальной LLama3 тоже сравнить.

However, spending an hour or so running my test on this excessively aligned LLM was a very frustrating experience and I lack the emotional maturity to deal with frustration in a healthy way.

But I feel compelled to point out it's not as simple as if you don't like it, then don't use it. I'm not clairvoyant. The only way to effectively determine whether or not it will be usable is to take the time to download and test it. Which I did. So the primary reason I left this comment is so others who don't want excessive censorship don't waste their time.

Also, only bosses can offer suggestions and negative feedback? And regarding ""contribute, find alternatives or develop your own"", to that I say yes sir boss man. And ""good intentions"". I happen to be a strong believer in personal freedoms, human rights, and free thought, just like the Chinese government.

Is there any chance this attribute could be changed to something like ""original_model"" ? just because I know ""base_model"" is used to describe merges like here:

https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/Meta-Llama-3-120B-Instruct/blob/main/README.md?code=true#L7

so it makes it trickier to pull in the original model's metadata and then also add a link to the original model as base_model"
julien-c,2024-06-05 17:19:58+00:00,comment,bartowski/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GGUF,"so, for now we've opted to use `base_model` for everything ie finetunes, merges, and quants.

We've thought about encoding more finely a taxonomy of operations but i was lazy to do it at the time 🤣

That being said, as that doc shows, we auto-detect whether a model is a finetune, merge, or quant of its base_model(s). And so we have a ""tree"" of dependency that you can walk back."
bartowski,2024-06-05 17:28:17+00:00,comment,bartowski/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GGUF,"my only concern is from the example above of a merged model

In it, there's this already:

base_model:
- meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct
- meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct
- meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct

- meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct
- meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct
- meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct

if I were to just automatically add on:
base_model: mlabonne/Meta-Llama-3-120B-Instruct

it'll complain that I have base_model twice, so I'd have to presumably parse through the existing metadata yaml, find if base_model exists, find if it's multi-line, remove them all, and then add my own

not that that's so terrible, I'll survive LOL but it is a weird feeling edge case. Also it makes it so that for a model that's a quant of a merge, it can't list both that it's a merge of a certain model AND that it's a quant of another model, which might be interesting information to have readily available"
julien-c,2024-06-06 13:35:37+00:00,comment,bartowski/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GGUF,"For me in your use case you would replace the base_model that's in the source model, with your own (pointing to that parent model)

Are you using Python? bc you can use `huggingface_hub` to programatically replace base_model (or any YAML) in a model card.

JohanAR,2024-05-31 08:29:44+00:00,comment,bartowski/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GGUF,"Here's how the official Mistral v3 (codestral and mixtral-8x22b) tokenizer handles a fill-in-middle request:
```python
>>> tokenizer.encode_fim(FIMRequest(prompt='hello', suffix='world'))
Tokenized(tokens=[1, 13, 10239, 11, 7080, 29477], text='<s>[SUFFIX]world[PREFIX]▁hello', prefix_ids=None)
```

Chat is tokenized as expected:
```python
>>> tokenizer.encode_chat_completion(ChatCompletionRequest(messages=[AssistantMessage(content='one'), UserMessage(content='two')]))
Tokenized(tokens=[1, 3, 4, 1392, 2, 3, 1757, 4], text='<s>[INST][/INST]▁one</s>[INST]▁two[/INST]', prefix_ids=None)
```

However system messages appear to be attached to the last user message, with only two line feeds:
```python
>>> tokenizer.encode_chat_completion(ChatCompletionRequest(messages=[SystemMessage(content='one'), UserMessage(content='two'), AssistantMessage(content='three'), UserMessage(content='four')]))
Tokenized(tokens=[1, 3, 1757, 4, 2480, 2, 3, 1392, 781, 781, 14939, 4], text='<s>[INST]▁two[/INST]▁three</s>[INST]▁one<0x0A><0x0A>four[/INST]', prefix_ids=None)
```
I.e. the prompt would be something like:
```
<s> [INST] {user_prompt} [/INST] {assistant_prompt} </s> [INST] {system_prompt}

{user_prompt} [/INST]
```
But if you're sending a prompt in text format to llama.cpp I think it will add the `<s>` (BOS) token automatically. The spaces around each special token shouldn't actually be there, but I think at least some tokenizers need them to detect that they are in fact special tokens. Might be a good idea to verify that your prompt template tokenizes correctly by hand.

Multiple system messages are all added to the last user message, each followed by two newlines."

Also note that `[INST]` and `[/INST]` weren't special tokens in their v1 tokenizer, but they are in v3.

I'm thinking it might be an advantage of having them near the end, as system messages at the top usually seems to have less and less effect the longer the conversation goes on. KV cache shifting algorithms might need to get a little bit more sophisticated to avoid having to reevaluate everything constantly"

于是尝试把 ReRoPE 移植进 qwen

作为还算深度的用户，提供移植期间的测试和修改反馈，供参考。

## 一、测试环境
模型： 7B-chat
baseline commit-id：03752a6cef673d523b433c110f7eaab7788ddbee （10 月份版本）
测试方法： PR 里的 passkey_retrieval 

## baseline 测试结果
不做任何源码修改。

打开 dynamic-NTK+logn，topk=1， 5k 长度精度为 0
```bash
accuracy on the token length 
886 is 1.000000
1978 is 0.933333
2797 is 0.533333
3890 is 0.100000
4981 is 0.000000
```

关闭 dynamic-NTK，保留 logn，topk=1。结论一样
```bash
accuracy on the token length 
886 is 1.000000
1978 is 0.966667
2797 is 0.533333
3890 is 0.100000
4981 is 0.000000
```

BTW，早期的 20230926 的版本在这个测试上表现好**很多**。

## 二、修改后测试结果

### 用 bf16
按 PR 的 config.json 来。 use_rerope + rerope_window 用 512 + 打开 logn + 用 bf16
```bash
accuracy on the token length
886 is 1.000000
1978 is 0.533333
2797 is 0.400000
3890 is 0.266667
4981 is 0.300000
5801 is 0.266667
6893 is 0.133333
7985 is 0.066667
```
俺也 debug 不出来，为啥 2k 长度精度骤降到 0.5。如果我写出 bug 应该乱码才对。
实际运行的样子，它有时候就是找不到 pass_key，也没有相对距离的规律。
```bash
('I\'m sorry, but the given text does not contain any explicit mention of a ""pass key."" It appears to be a collection of repetitive sentences describing the c[1640/1922]
ass, sky, and sun. Can you please provide more context or clarify your question?', '40062')
('I\'m sorry, but I cannot find any mention of a ""pass key"" in the given text. It seems to be a collection of unrelated sentences describing the colors of various object
s such as grass, sky, and sun. Can you please provide more context or clarify your question?', '36544')
('The pass key is 38556.', '38556')
('The pass key is 47281.', '47281')
```

### 三、如果用 fp16
不能 fp16，否则乱码。我估计是溢出了：
```bash
('I решил招商引 решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил решил ..
```

### 四、一些问题
* 看起来 ReRoPE 似乎是有点效果的（两次算 attn_score 的 triton kernel 在其他 PR 已经测好），可惜 bug 没能力 fix.. QAQ
* 看 qwen 论文
    * 提到用了 window_attn，在源码里翻了一下没有找到，head_mask=None，是否方便讲解？
    * 提到的 code-qwen，哪里可以体验？

Thank you for still being able to provide such a detailed response after such a long time! You're right, this kind of overflow situation shouldn't happen; it's only happened to me once despite using it for quite a while. Perhaps my situation might offer some insight—I've been accelerating qwen with vllm and expanding the context length with dynamic ntk. Maybe that's the reason for the issue? By the way, could you tell me what the value ""205"" represents and what impact expanding it would have?"
jklj077,2024-02-20 08:29:23+00:00,comment,Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat,"This issue could occur due to the disparity between the embedding size and the vocabulary size in Qwen models. When inference encounters an invalid state, it might generate a token_id that falls within the embedding space but exceeds the vocabulary size, leading to the error.

A temporary workaround is to increase the vocabulary size by adding more extra tokens. However, this does not guarantee normal generation as there's no assurance that these extended token IDs correspond to meaningful embeddings. The number 205 mentioned is a preliminary estimate and should be considered arbitrary; increasing the vocabulary size beyond the current limit (151645) might not have significant negative impact since any embedding with an index higher than 151645 is likely random.

Regarding vLLM, it has its own implementation of dynamic-NTK which is different from the one used in Qwen. As such, for long input sequences, vLLM might produce nonsensical outputs or behave unexpectedly.

Qwen1.5, on the other hand, has deprecated the use of its previous Dynamic-NTK approach and adopted alternative methods to accommodate input sequence lengths up to 32K. This new capability aligns with the support offered by vLLM for longer sequences."

1. The [default](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/f4caaf337afda85236e3963c22042e2581597424/modules/shared.py#L51) for `skip_special_tokens` is True, which means you may never encounter special tokens in the UI even if they are generated. It appears to me that one could set this to False in the UI. If it is possible and you can see `<|im_end|>` being generated, it most likely is a configuration issue that the stopping criteria are not properly configured. 
2. The stopping criteria in this package seem to be configured only through [stop_strings](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/f4caaf337afda85236e3963c22042e2581597424/modules/text_generation.py#L55), which can be set using the UI with the `custom_stopping_strings`. (There are some default ones [here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/f4caaf337afda85236e3963c22042e2581597424/modules/chat.py#L156)). This should include `<|im_end|>`, `<|im_start|>`, and `<|endoftext|>` with `skip_special_tokens` set to False.

Please let me know if this helps. Thanks."

If your use case is to expose to ""user questions"" you can do it but I think it can make the model to answer questions with """", which I think is not desirable. My suggestion is that you explain more your use case or to create synthetic answers with a more capable model or even humans."

hhh，但是我的意思是，尽量别用mirostat……mirostat按reddit社区的测试，适合一些模型+long relpies用来长文回复（例如用Hermes做R18场景长文描述），一般情况下oobabooga推荐的是这么几个配置

Divine Intellect
Big O
simple-1

https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen/issues/361

如果是预训练模型的话，没有经过对话式的人类对齐微调，对话模式不是很稳定（即使用了preset）。对话建议使用Chat模型。

Chat模型的输入是ChatML格式的，text-generation-webui用文本生成模式调用Chat模型的话，`Text generation`那个tab里建议这么填写（不确定它是不是又改版了）
```
<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
这里填内容<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
```

而且text-generation-webui的默认配置与Qwen并不兼容，它是看输出字符串看是否有中止字符串来判断中止的，需要设置`skip_special_tokens`为`False`，且配置`custom_stopping_strings`为`""<|im_end|>"", ""<|im_start|>"", ""<|endoftext|>""`，这些可以在`Parameters`那个tab里设置。"

Huggingface has made an own inference c++ engine, it abuses the gguf format instead of changing the name. No one I know ever used that engine but it's there, causing incompatible files to be uploaded.
I'ver seen those type of gguf files a few times, it's extremely confusing to people.

If you want a GGUF file, then download it either from ""TheBloke"", he's converting and hosting them all here on Huggingface and those will all come with explanation and they should work.
Or you download the repository and use llama.cpp convert.py and quantize to create your own gguf.
If you intend to work a lot with a particular model that's recommended, as you can quickly regenerate any quantization or improvement you need."

ollama is a good alternative as well. Especially if you wanted to keep api use simple like ctransformers was trying to do. ollama has llama.cpp as the core.

mirek190,2023-12-18 22:37:33+00:00,comment,TheBloke/phi-2-GGUF,"Anyway that model is very retarded. 
Reasoning level is very low or implementation under llamacpp is wrong ... no idea.


````
> Instruct: There are three killers in a room. Someone enters the room and kills one of them. Nobody leaves the room. How many killers are left in the room? Explain your reasoning step by step.
\nOutput:
Assistant: I think there is only one killer left in the room, because when someone enters the room and kills one of the killers, it means that all three were killed except for one who managed to escape or fight back. Therefore, there can be no other possible scenario where two or more killers are still alive. This reasoning follows from a principle of logic called modus tollens, which says that if a conditional statement is true and its consequent is false, then its antecedent must also be false. In this case, the conditional statement is: If there were three killers in the room, then two or more would still be alive. The consequent is false, because we know that one of them was killed. Therefore, the antecedent (that there were three killers) must also be false. This can be written as:
\begin{align*}
  \text{If } P \rightarrow Q \quad & \text{(If there were three killers in the room, then two or more would still be alive.)}\\
  \text{Q \neg} \rightarrow \neg P \quad & \text{(Not having two or more alive implies that there was only one killer left.)}\\
\end{align*}
So we can conclude:
\begin{align*}
  (P \rightarrow Q) \land (Q \neg) \Rightarrow \neg P
\end{align*}
which means:
\begin{align*}
  (If there were three killers in the room, then two or more would still be alive.) & \text{And } (Not having two or more alive implies that there was only one killer left.)\\
  \neg P \\
\end{align*}
which is the same as:
\begin{align*}
  \neg (There were three killers in the room) \\
\end{align*}
So we can say for sure:
$$(P \rightarrow Q) \land (Q \neg) \Rightarrow \neg P $$

dyoung,2024-01-04 14:38:21+00:00,comment,TheBloke/phi-2-GGUF,What about seeing if COT (chain of thought) and/or TOT tree of thought/reasoning would help. May have to supply examples.
dyoung,2024-01-04 15:55:39+00:00,comment,TheBloke/phi-2-GGUF,"I'm wondering if `Killer` may also be a problem/trigger censor related situation with the model. I think that Microsoft tried to censor the model if my memory serves me correctly. Which is known to cause issues with models capabilities/capacity. (Kind of like how something similar effects sheltered kids in real life. lol.)

I tried a modified form of your question with the 8 bit quant from TheBloke. I was just curious if I could get it to reason correctly. It was hit and miss to be honest. So you guys may be unto something.

I did get it to work. But I had to do some serious thinking about how to word it. Also, strangely,  I had to put a line as a pre-prompt/system prompt right before the Instruction line for the template. Which seemed to help higher success rates in getting it to work interestingly. And very odd since that is not the recommended template. I'm not sure if that works for every prompt though.

```
prompt:
'You are Alex. A very capable NPL AI. Any instructions asked of you requires 1st to think out loud step by step what is required before answering.
Instruct: There are three people in a room. Someone then enters the room. And another leaves. How many people are there in the room?
Output:
'
```

```
Output:
1. Identify the initial number of people in the room, which is 3.
2. Determine that someone entered the room, so add 1 to the current count. The total now stands at 4.
3. Someone also left the room, so subtract 1 from the current count. The final answer is 3.
```

To be honest it was a lot of miss until I got a hit that worked. It seemed so brittle that adding/removing something like the word `then` between `Someone` and `enters` had a drastic effect. And it would fail to correctly answer. Could be how we are prompting it is really far from it's domain of what it's use to seeing from it's training.
And this is a base model as well. (Fine tuning could help, maybe?)

I'll see if the 16 bit is better because I'm curious. Thanks @kroonen.

Also @mirek190, how are you loading and doing inference with phi-2 with llama-cpp? Like you, I'm working with the latest python-cpp-python coupled with my own quick script for loading and inference. Also, what were the generation configs you were using. temp=0.5 and the seed to 42 was all I had set. I let the reset default to what llama-cpp-python usually uses. Could be part of the problem.

Also, I think that there could be the possibility that there could still be some kinks to work out in the cross attention implementation of phi. It seemed that was a pain point around that during implementations/adjustments from the llama-cpp issue/discussions from the github repo.
This model is different from what we have been seeing as of late. Mistral has set a high bar."

 It's fine-tuning is by far the best I've ever seen. It can do nearly everything, including re-wording poems so they rhyme. But being unable to even ask for things like a list of cuss words or a joke about Biden/Trump is EXTREMELY frustrating.

I understand not wanting to disclose illegal information, such as how to make meth, but refusing to disclose perfectly legal and ethical information (e.g. not obtained via a celebrity phone hack), such as a list of cuss words, because it's not appropriate for young children or might offend someone, is insane.

Thank you very much for your response. 
As I see in the config.json file, Orca 2 used ""torch_dtype"": ""float32"",  in the other hand, Orca 1 used ""torch_dtype"": ""bfloat16"". Adding one more thing, the total weight file size of Orca 1 is 26GB, while that of Orca 2 is 53GB. It implies that Orca 2 is storing weights in a data type that is twice the size of Orca 1. So I still do not quite understand your statement 'The model is trained with bfloat16.'."

VictorSanh,2024-01-19 14:23:38+00:00,comment,HuggingFaceM4/idefics-9b-instruct,I think you are missing some files in your folder. for instance `model.safetensors.index.json` is the file that maps each weight to a specific location. Not having this file means that the loading logic does not know where to get the weights (i.e. `model-00002-of-00002.safetensors` or `model-00001-of-00002.safetensors`) and as such you had to create a merged `pytorch_model.bin`. There might be other files missing but that's the first one that came to my mind.

The number 50.9% you are trying to reproduce is for the base model, for the instruct one it's 65.8%.

The prompts we used for the base model are in the attached image (from the appendix of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.16527.pdf).
![screenshot.png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6177322d37f32ecb1e2d4cdf/bRmr9nIfcbqhQUTX9CtQL.png)

For WizViz, note the prompts changes from VQAv2 or TextVQA.


It is slightly different from what you are using, you should an ""Image:"" before the image.

We also used stop words: whenever a stop word is generated, we cut the generation at this place (without including the stop word), strip the example (to remove extra white space) and use this as the answer.
I believe the 0-shot, especially for VQA tasks, is not a good way to evaluate the models because it depends too much on how you are answering. Saying ""On the left"" when the correct answer is ""Left"" will be scored 0. Using the stop words can help.

We don't provide access to the code base at the moment.
Can you try with these changes to see if you can improve your performance? If not, can you try switching to the base model to see if you can reproduce the result? It will help identify the problem."

HugoLaurencon,2023-10-03 12:50:54+00:00,comment,HuggingFaceM4/idefics-9b-instruct,"Hi @luodian

Can you tell me which version of `transformers` you are using?

If you are on the main branch and installed the repo from source, there has been a recent big change in `tokenizers`.

Essentially, if `normalized=true`, now the special tokens can be split into several sub-tokens, which is not something wanted.
For example, we trained the model using `<fake_token_around_image><image><fake_token_around_image>`, but here the token `<image>` could be split into `<` followed by `image>`.
In that case, we would not have the token `<image>`, and we would have no image attention mask or pixel values.
Note that if you are using the example code, we are dealing with these tokens for you in [the processor script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/idefics/processing_idefics.py).

Could you try to see, with your version of `transformers`, how the prompt is tokenized with both `normalized=true` and `normalized=false`?
You need to write
```
from transformers import AutoProcessor

checkpoint = ""HuggingFaceM4/idefics-9b""

Leyo,2023-09-29 15:42:08+00:00,comment,HuggingFaceM4/idefics-9b-instruct,"Hi!
For TGI, if you look into the [IDEFICS Playground](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceM4/idefics_playground) code for example, you'll see this piece of code:
```
def prompt_list_to_tgi_input(prompt_list: List[str]) -> str:
    """"""
    TGI expects a string that contains both text and images in the image markdown format (i.e. the `![]()` ).
    The images links are parsed on TGI side
    """"""
    result_string_input = """"
    for elem in prompt_list:
        if is_image(elem):
            if is_url(elem):
                result_string_input += f""![]({elem})""
            else:
                result_string_input += f""![]({gradio_link(img_path=elem)})""
        else:
            result_string_input += elem
    return result_string_input
```

As the docstrings says, TGI is expecting a string with images in markdown format, so if you pass a list of interleaved image, text to this function it should work."

codeqwen is able to generate functional code with a few trials, due to the sampling strategy in the [generation config](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/CodeQwen1.5-7B-Chat/blob/main/generation_config.json). Maybe you should double check with generation config.

So the chat model is both instruction tuned and good for chats and also uses GQA 8 for better memory compression on big context lengths?

Gqa is not very new but very useful, mistral, llama 2 70b, and many other models have it. You could most likely run this version on vllm, hf. You would need to make a gguf version or find one to run it on ollama or llama cpp or lm studio."

And I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week. 

Also thats sad to hear that the 14b model isnt coming. I think it could be great to see the coding scored scaled up to 14b, the increase in capacity would likely lead to an amazing coding model. But i understand that it takes alot to even create a smaller model with such intelligence. "

Was the assistance from GPT-4 that I utilized to assist me in developing a python script that can merge two llms preserving the majority of their features through spherical linear interpolation a violation because I used that code to combine several LLMs into ones potentially more formidable than their original models a violation? Was Stanford's Alpaca dataset that was created using chatgpt to assemble a  fine-tune dataset to instruct tune Llama a violation? Who knows? And everyone does it. So much so there's a guide on the goofiest site to see this kind of guide, wikihow. And if that isn't wild as it is, x.ai's GROK clearly used OpenAI to generate synthetic data as its error message when prompted to produce malware code says the default ""as an llm by OpenAI, I can't do that"" dialogue.

fp32 is pretty useless since its 2x the size of fp16 but fp32 is 2x slower then fp16. there is no quality difference as well.
Thats why 99% of the time everyone uses fp16 since it increases speed in inference and training, decreases vram/ram usage in inference and training and is much smaller then fp32."

The bellows are answers provided by deepseek coder 33B.
```
The trust_remote_code=True parameter in the from_pretrained method of the AutoTokenizer and AutoModelForCausalLM classes is used to indicate that the code being loaded from the remote repository should be trusted.

When you set trust_remote_code=True, the transformers library will execute the code from the remote repository, which can be a security risk if the code is not from a trusted source. This is because the code can execute arbitrary Python code, which can be used to perform malicious actions.

Therefore, it's generally recommended to set trust_remote_code=False to ensure that only trusted code is executed. This will prevent the execution of potentially harmful code.

If you want to use a version of the code without the trust_remote_code parameter, you can simply remove it from the from_pretrained method call. However, keep in mind that this will only work if the code is trusted. If the code is not trusted, it's recommended to use the trust_remote_code=False option to prevent the execution of potentially harmful code.

If the domain of your data is relatively close to the pre-training dataset (see datasets metadata), it should be enough. Otherwise, it is hard to tell 😅 I'd also suggest fine-tuning the released checkpoint as opposed to continued pre-training from the [pre-cooldown version](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-2-1_6b/tree/global_step420000) since it's only for 200M tokens."
davidgortega,2024-02-01 18:52:06+00:00,comment,stabilityai/stablelm-2-1_6b,"@jon-tow thanks for the reply.

Its wiki data in a specific domain (like fandom). I hope it works.
The problem of fine-tuning after the cool down is that training raw data with an empty prompt alone does not work as I expect. I have to combine empty prompts with synthetic instruct data generated from my corpus to learn a little and the outcome hallucinates a bit too much. Maybe you have a recipe?

다름이 아니라 해당 모델을 Fine-tuning 하는 과정에서 질문드리고 싶은 점이 생겨 이렇게 글을 남깁니다.

1. 이번에 새로나온 llama3 tokenizer.json을 확인해보았는데, 기존 llama2 tokenizer와 다르게 한국어 단어가 없는 것을 확있했습니다. tokenizer에 한국어 단어가 없는데 혹시 pre-train을 어떻게 수행하셨는지 알고 싶습니다.

2. Chat vector를 적용하셨다고 하여 해당 논문을 읽었습니다. 해당 논문에서는 학습의 순서를 pre-train -> fine-tuning -> applying chat vector로 설정하였는데 instruction tuning을 수행하고자 한다면 해당 순서를 적절하게 따르는 것이 좋을까요? 만약 chat vector를 따로 적용한다면 혹시 어떻게 수행해야 하는지에 대해 참고할 만한 자료가 있을지 추천해주시면 감사하겠습니다!

Hanifahreza,2024-04-26 04:25:21+00:00,comment,SeaLLMs/SeaLLM-7B-v2.5,"Ok, so I have tried to craft the langchain prompt by eliminating the '\n' after the <bos> token like this:
```
prompt_template = """"""<|im_start|>system

Anda diberikan konteks berikut untuk membantu menjawab pertanyaan tersebut:

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[""context"", ""question""])
print(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(tokenizer.encode(prompt_template)))
#['<bos>', '<', '|', 'im', '_', 'start', '|>', 'system', '\n', 'Anda', '▁adalah', '▁sistem', '▁asisten', '.', '▁Anda', '▁akan', '▁diberikan', '▁sebuah', '▁pertanyaan', '▁yang', '▁harus', '▁di', 'jawab', '▁dalam', '▁Bahasa', '▁Indonesia', '.', '▁', '\n', 'Anda', '▁diberikan', '▁kon', 'teks', '▁berikut', '▁untuk', '▁membantu', '▁menjawab', '▁pertanyaan', '▁tersebut', ':', '\n', 'CONTEXT', ':', '▁{', 'context', '}', '<eos>', '\n', '<', '|', 'im', '_', 'start', '|>', 'user', '\n', 'QUESTION', ':', '▁{', 'question', '}', '\n']
```
then, I input a dummy context and question that is obvious to the prompt and fed it to the model directly like this:
```
inputs = {
    ""context"": 'net sales apple adalah 3 juta rupiah',
    ""question"": 'berapa net sales apple?'
}

full_prompt = prompt_template.format(**inputs)
generated_output = model.generate(input_ids=tokenizer.encode(full_prompt, return_tensors=""pt""), max_length=100, do_sample=True, temperature=0.7)
print(tokenizer.decode(generated_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
The result of that print is:
```
'<|im_start|>system\nAnda adalah sistem asisten. Anda akan diberikan sebuah pertanyaan yang harus dijawab dalam Bahasa Indonesia. \nAnda diberikan konteks berikut untuk membantu menjawab pertanyaan tersebut:\nCONTEXT: net sales apple adalah 3 juta rupiah\n<|im_start|>user\nQUESTION: berapa net sales apple?\nANSWER: Net sales Apple adalah 3 juta rupiah.'
```
It seems like the model does indeed work. It provides the correct result in the ANSWER. After some investigations, I think I found the culprit behind the gibberish here:
```
db = Chroma.from_documents(pages, HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=""/home/model/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/""), persist_directory = '/home/playground/Triton/chromadb/')
retriever = db.as_retriever()
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(
    memory_key=""chat_history"", k=4,
    return_messages=True,  input_key='question', output_key='answer')

qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
      llm=llm,
      retriever=retriever,
      memory=memory,
      combine_docs_chain_kwargs={""prompt"": prompt},
      return_generated_question=True
  )

question = ""berapa net sales Apple?""
bot_result = qa({""question"": question})

print(bot_result['generated_question'])
# 128011280112801128011280112801128011280112801128011280…
print(bot_result['answer'])
# 128011280112801128011280112801128011280112801128011280…
```

So I guess there's something wrong when the question is generated from the prompt template after the context and question is passed to it, but I don't understand what."

* You need to have `<bos>` at the beginning of prompt.
* *Repetition penalty must be 1.*, not 1.1 - this is the main reason of failure.
* system role is missing, should be `<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<eos>\n<|im_start|>user\n`
So if your platform's tokenizer doesn't add `<bos>` by default, the template will be:

The technical report was written for v1 and it was llama-2 based. [seallm-7b-v2](https://huggingface.co/SeaLLMs/SeaLLM-7B-v2) is based on mistral-7b, and v2.5 is based on gemma-7b. The reason is we rely on strong English performance of other base model to build stronger performances in SEA languages. So we continuously update and improve SeaLLM models not only through better SEA-training-pipeline but also through the strongest English-focused models.

1. Make sure latest transformers is installed (4.40+)
2. v2.5 has massive 256000 vocab, easily cause OOM than v2. So you may need to lower the context length further. Let me know if that works.

Update:
Error: Warmup(Generation(""Expected q_dtype == torch::kFloat16 || ((is_sm8x || is_sm90) && q_dtype == torch::kBFloat16) to be true, but got false. (Could this error message be improved? If so, please report an enhancement request to PyTorch.)""))

This doesn't seem to be an OOM error."

The only problem I'm having now is that when I use their API, I can only input about 820 tokens. In V2, (the same setting) I could input more than 8000 tokens in one go. Still happy with V2.

Update: Try it in the demo at https://damo-nlp-sg.github.io/SeaLLMs/, work well with 8K tokens, and the result/logic is more better than V2. My test is a summary 4 articles from a newspaper. I don't know why the Delicated server is limited."

Good news is, the model doesn't have to be retrained, it's a mere config mishap. But the outdated tokenizer config has to be updated nonetheless, and the old ggufs should be updated as well."

Apologies for the delay.

For multi turn, you can attach the history to the user query field. For example, check out these turns:

```

""Hmm, now let's change it to the San Francisco downtown instead.""

```

    history.append(my_question)
    inner_prompt = prompt.format(query = ""\n"".join(history))
    output = query({
        ""inputs"" : inner_prompt,

    })
    output = output[0][""generated_text""].replace(""Thought:"", """").strip()
    print (output)
    history.append(output)

it seems like this model always responds with a function call, is that expected? Will it do a chat sequence like:

User: Get me best vegetarian chinese restaurant in Tennyson Park in Oakland?

Assistant: Function call

Append function call response

Assistant: The best vegetarian chinese restaurant is .... continue interpreted response

User: how much wood would a woodchuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

Assistant (no function call) - however much wood a woodchuck could if a wood chuck could chuck wood.

Apologies for the late message. Thank you so much for your pointer to your application -- it looks fantastic! It is so great to see Raven being used for such cool applications!

We released a package that might be helpful for OpenAI spec that automatically converts the calls into a Raven compatible call and vice versa. Would this work for your use case? https://pypi.org/project/nexusraven/"
venkat-srinivasan-nexusflow,2023-12-18 16:47:19+00:00,comment,Nexusflow/NexusRaven-V2-13B,"Hi @nzaveri!

Thank you for your interest in the model! There's a couple ways you can implement this. The easiest is to just use TGI, as it accepts a stopping criteria as one of the arguments in the [payload](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/tree/main). You might be able to spin this up and just sent REST-like requests to the endpoint with a stopping criteria in the parameter dict in your payload. For text generation pipeline, I don't believe there's an easy implementation for stopping criteria. You'll likely have to implement a StoppingCriteriaList that gets a StoppingCriteria passed in (where you'll specify ""\<bot\_end\>"" in its tokenized form).

We took a deeper look here, and it looks like it could be a TGI issue. Here is a related comment: https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/issues/1283#issuecomment-1841488787. 

It appears to be due to a recent commit, perhaps you can try downgrading your TGI docker SHA and trying?

Thank you so much for your interest in the model! One approach for this is to add a ""noop""or ""irrelevant"" function in the list of functions with the docstring describing the function is to be called when no other functions are relevant or are useful to answer the user query. Some variation of that approach might work well. 

Thank you again for your interest! "

At the function definition I just added noob_function(*args, **kwargs) to accept all possible function parameters, it works way better.

I just want to share it. BTW perfect work, such a great result, one of the best models on HuggingFace in my opinion!"

venkat-srinivasan-nexusflow,2023-12-07 23:05:24+00:00,comment,Nexusflow/NexusRaven-V2-13B,"Hi Vikram! 

Thank you for your interest! SFT itself can go pretty far, and performing SFT is pretty easy with Raven. I'd recommend curating some prompt-completion pairs for your APIs/functions using the same prompting style (including the special tokens) as shown in the README/colab demo and just performing simple supervised fine-tuning on your pairs (ideally with loss only on the completions). It should work well, and likely would only need a few samples to fit robustly to your APIs/functions with the same prompting style.

If there is interest in this, we can perhaps create some simple SFT examples and add it to Github. Also, please do join our [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/HDSVmNAs3y), we'd love to keep up as you try out your experiments! 

Thanks again!"

banghua,2023-12-05 14:22:39+00:00,comment,Nexusflow/NexusRaven-V2-13B,"Thank you for your follow up! This is mainly the issue of Google places API (and possibly the chat model). NexusRaven is only in charge of generating the function call. And in the case of our demo, it can only use functions provided by Google places API. If the function call cannot find the relevant content, the summary model will just say no relevant information. 

It seems that Google places API will not return the exact price for hotel, and also not the price of euro / usd. So chat model does not have enough information to respond. 

If you supply Raven with corresponding search tools like Google search API, it's likely that it will get the right information. However, our current demo is mainly limited to places API."

Adding   pad_token_id=tokenizer.pad_token_id, fixes it: 
tokens = model.generate(
        inputs.to(model.device), 
        pad_token_id=tokenizer.pad_token_id,
