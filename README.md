script and data for analysing

All extractions are based on the [huggingface_hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.22.1/en/guides/overview) API provided by HuggingFace. 

The datasets folder provides the model code repository classified as text generation that we extracted on March 5, 2024.

Three examples of extracting information through `huggingface_hub` are stored in the script folder.
